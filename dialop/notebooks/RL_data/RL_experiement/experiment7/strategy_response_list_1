["1. **Preference Prioritization**: Start by acknowledging and confirming the user's top preferences, such as visiting Central Plaza, The Mall, and landmarks with historical significance. Make sure to ask if there are any other specific types of landmarks or outdoor activities they are interested in. This ensures all important preferences are captured early on.", "2. **Proactive Clarification**: Since there is a limitation on the number of places you can propose, clarify with the user whether parking availability is a deal-breaker or if they are willing to explore nearby parking options. This will help you prioritize the inclusion of their preferred places without assuming their needs.", "3. **Tool Utilization for Information Enrichment**: Use available tools to quickly gather more information about potential places that meet the user's criteria, such as historical significance and kid-friendliness. Provide the user with detailed options that align with their priorities, ensuring a well-informed decision-making process for the final itinerary."]
