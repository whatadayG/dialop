["1. **Clarification and Prioritization Strategy**: Before proceeding, ask the user to clarify any additional preferences or must-haves that might not have been mentioned yet, such as specific cuisines or types of cafes they prefer. Ensure that the most critical elements (live music, non-touristy, good for groups, parking, takeout, and a cafe) are clearly prioritized by the user.", "2. **Recommendation Refinement Strategy**: Use available tools to research and suggest a couple more locations that fit the user's primary preferences, such as cafes with live music or non-touristy spots with takeout options. Present these options with a brief explanation of why they fit the criteria and ask the user to prioritize them.", "3. **Efficiency and Confirmation Strategy**: Present a brief summary of the user's preferences and the current itinerary (including The Dive). Confirm with the user if there are any additional preferences or changes they would like to make, ensuring the conversation remains concise and focused on refining the final itinerary with the most important locations."]
