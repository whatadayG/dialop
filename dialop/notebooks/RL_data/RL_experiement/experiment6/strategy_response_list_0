["1. **Prioritize Preferences Strategy**: Begin by summarizing the user's key preferences, emphasizing those that have been mentioned most frequently or with high importance. Validate with the user if there are any additional critical preferences. This ensures you focus on the most important factors when selecting locations, such as landmarks, kid-friendliness, parking, outdoor seating, live music, and vegan options.", "2. **Clarification and Expansion Strategy**: Ask the user if they have any specific landmarks in mind or if they are open to suggestions. Inquire if there are particular preferences for live music genres or specific outdoor activities that their kids enjoy. This approach will help refine the search criteria and ensure no important detail is overlooked.", "3. **Utilize Information Tools Strategy**: Leverage available tools to gather additional information about potential landmarks, focusing on those that offer live music and vegan options. Share the findings with the user to gauge their interest and prioritize which landmarks to include in the final itinerary. This will make the recommendation more tailored and likely to align with the user's preferences."]
