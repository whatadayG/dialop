["1. **Clarify and Confirm Key Preferences**: Summarize and confirm the user's key preferences to ensure you have understood them correctly. For instance, restate the user's interest in visiting at least one landmark, their flexibility with parking, their budget, dietary preferences, and the need for kid-friendly places. This helps in ensuring that all preferences are acknowledged and addressed.", "2. **Use Tools to Discover Matching Locations**: Utilize available tools to search for locations that match the user's preferences, including budget-friendly and vegan dining options that are also kid-friendly, potentially near The Tower, Central Plaza, and The Mall. Provide the user with a couple of options and ask if they are interested in any of these or if there are further preferences.", "3. **Optimize Proposal with Prioritization**: When proposing the final itinerary, emphasize how each location aligns with the user's preferences, mentioning specific aspects like vegan options or kid-friendliness, and explain why they were chosen. Ask the user to prioritize any preferences if necessary, to ensure the final three locations are the best fit for their needs."]
