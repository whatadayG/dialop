["[message] Great, in that case, considering your preferences and the distance between places, here is a proposed itinerary: Visit Central Plaza and The Mall first as per your request. For the landmark, consider \"The Tower\", it's located nearby and has parking too. Lastly, have dinner at The Dockside Grill, they have great vegan options and live music too. How does this sound to you?", "[think] There's only one restaurant available, so it seems to be the only option.", "[message] I found The Dockside Grill restaurant, which is only 0.5 miles away from Central Plaza. This restaurant offers seafood cuisine, live music and vegan options. Would you be interested in visiting there?"]
