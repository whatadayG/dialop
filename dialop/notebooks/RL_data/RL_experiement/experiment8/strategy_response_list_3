["1. Prioritize Confirming the User's Top Preferences: Clearly confirm the user's top priorities, such as specific sites or conditions (e.g., family-friendly, vegan options), to ensure the final itinerary aligns with their most important preferences. This will help avoid missing any critical detail and ensure the proposed itinerary is satisfactory.", "2. Use Tools to Validate and Explore Options: Leverage available tools to verify the suitability of suggested locations. For example, check for family-friendly ratings and validate if the suggested locations align with user preferences like vegan options and budget. This ensures that the recommendations are well-informed and meet the user's criteria.", "3. Encourage Conciseness with Direct Questions: Use targeted questions to elicit concise and specific responses from the user. For instance, ask if there are any non-negotiable preferences or if they'd like more variety in the type of cuisine or activity, then promptly verify with a tool. This minimizes conversation length while maximizing the relevance of the itinerary."]
