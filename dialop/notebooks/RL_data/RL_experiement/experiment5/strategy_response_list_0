["1. **Confirm Priorities and Preferences**: Restate the user's preferences to ensure understanding. \"Great, so you would like to visit Central Plaza and The Mall, and would also like at least one landmark. Parking is not a priority. Is that correct?\" This helps clarify the user's priorities and ensures no preferences are overlooked.", "2. **Inquire About Additional Interests or Preferences**: Ask if there are any other preferences or types of attractions the user might want to include. \"Are there any other specific types of attractions or activities you're interested in, or any other must-see places on your list?\" This helps uncover any additional preferences that could influence the final itinerary.", "3. **Leverage Tools for Detailed Information**: Use available tools to gather detailed information about Central Plaza, The Mall, and potential landmarks. \"Let me gather some more details about Central Plaza, The Mall, and some popular landmarks nearby. I'll find options that fit your interests best.\" This ensures that the recommendations are well-informed and tailored to the user's stated preferences."]
