["[message] I understand, I see that parking and minimizing travel distance are priorities for you. Could you rank your food preferences in order of importance for you? And are there any specific destinations you definitely want to include on your itinerary?", "[message] Great, let's explore cafes nearby. What types of cuisine do you prioritize among Japanese, seafood, Chinese, kosher, French, Ethiopian, Korean, and American food? It would help in finding the most suitable food places for you.", "[message] Okay, got it! I see that you enjoy a diverse selection of cuisines, want places with parking, prefer a cafe, and would like the travel distance between the places to be as minimal as possible. Do you also prefer a particular type of activity or environment? As for the cafes without parking, should we prioritize the type of cuisine or the presence of parking if we need to make a choice?"]
