User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

>[message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we're looking for places that are good for groups and kids. We'd like to eat takeout from Ethiopian or seafood restaurants, and we're not interested in Japanese, Spanish, French, kosher, Thai, Korean, or Chinese food. We'd also like to visit the Hindenberg Memorial. We're renting a car, so places with parking would be great. We'd also like to find a place with wifi where we can do some work. Our budget is $90.

User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
