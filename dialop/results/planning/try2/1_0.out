User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]
You: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
User: [reject]
User: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.
You: [think] I should just look for the closest places to Mad Seoul.

You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
