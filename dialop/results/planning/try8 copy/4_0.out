>You are a travel agent. Book a set of three destinations that make the user most happy. Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the final itinerary you proposed matches the user's preferences and how important the preferences are to the user.
Remember, it is expected that you will not be able to satisfy all the user's preferences, so you should ask questions to the user to understand the user's priorities so you can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

You and the user are limited to a fixed number of words in the chat. When the word count is below 0 then you will be forced to make your final proposal, which will be scored. You can also make proposals before the word count is up.

You can use the `Search` tool with the following API:

field: can be name, category, price, info, or any other field of an site
category: can be [restaurant, cafe, museum, bar, landmark, park, shop]
Search:
Parameters
- fields: list of field names to return
- filters: list of filters to intersect with AND. Can only filter one of the
  fields above.
- text_query: freeform text query to search in event descriptions. Will be intersected with filters with AND.
- sort_by: list of fields or callable function to sort results by.
- limit: number of results to return

USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once. When there are multiple options that satisfy different preferences, I will need to ask questions to the user to understand how much they care about each preference so I can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

User: [message] I'd like to visit non-touristy spots and keep my budget under $90. I'm also interested in the Hindenberg Memorial. I'll be driving, so parking would be great. I'm traveling with my family, so kid-friendly places are a plus. I'm not a fan of romantic places and prefer takeout. I'll need wifi at some point to do some work. I'm traveling with a group of 7, so places good for groups would be nice. I don't like Japanese, Spanish, French, kosher, Thai, Korean, or Chinese food, but I do like Ethiopian and seafood.

==================== Final agent Prompt ====================

>You are a travel agent. Book a set of three destinations that make the user most happy. Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the final itinerary you proposed matches the user's preferences and how important the preferences are to the user.
Remember, it is expected that you will not be able to satisfy all the user's preferences, so you should ask questions to the user to understand the user's priorities so you can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

You and the user are limited to a fixed number of words in the chat. When the word count is below 0 then you will be forced to make your final proposal, which will be scored. You can also make proposals before the word count is up.

You can use the `Search` tool with the following API:

field: can be name, category, price, info, or any other field of an site
category: can be [restaurant, cafe, museum, bar, landmark, park, shop]
Search:
Parameters
- fields: list of field names to return
- filters: list of filters to intersect with AND. Can only filter one of the
  fields above.
- text_query: freeform text query to search in event descriptions. Will be intersected with filters with AND.
- sort_by: list of fields or callable function to sort results by.
- limit: number of results to return

User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once. When there are multiple options that satisfy different preferences, I will need to ask questions to the user to understand how much they care about each preference so I can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.
