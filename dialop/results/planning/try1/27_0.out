You: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
You: [think] Concert is not a category I can search by. I should look for a restaurant that is close to Mad Seoul and satisfies the user's preferences as much as possible.
