User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip and would love to visit a museum and some landmarks like The Tower and Einstein's summer house. I'd prefer places that are good for kids and offer takeout, especially Chinese food with vegetarian options. Also, I'm not a fan of classy places or live music, and I'd like to explore some hidden, non-touristy spots. Could you help me find some options that minimize travel distance?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

You:\[message] I'm planning a family trip and would love to visit a museum and some landmarks like The Tower and Einstein's summer house. I'd prefer places that are good for kids and offer takeout, especially Chinese food with vegetarian options. Also, I'm not a fan of classy places or live music, and I'd like to explore some hidden, non-touristy spots. Could you help me find some options that minimize travel distance?

Agent: \[message] I've put together a proposal that includes The Tower, Einstein's summer house, and Liberty Memorial. These landmarks are non-touristy, family-friendly, and close to each other, minimizing travel distance. While I couldn't find a perfect match for the restaurant, these landmarks should provide a great experience for your family trip. Let me know what you think!You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect.
You:\[think] The proposal includes the landmarks I wanted to visit, but it doesn't include a museum, which is important to me. The travel distances between the landmarks are also quite significant, which is not ideal. However, the agent has tried to accommodate my preferences as much as possible. I should consider accepting the proposal if I can compromise on the museum visit and focus on the landmarks and minimizing travel distance.
