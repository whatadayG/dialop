User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] I'm planning a day in the city and would love to visit at least one landmark. I'm also interested in checking out Dan's recommendations: Schwarzes Cafe and Asha Tea House. I prefer outdoor seating due to COVID concerns and would like to keep the budget below $70. Additionally, I'm looking for places that aren't too casual and have vegetarian options.
You: [message] I'm sorry, there was an error in my previous response. Let me continue assisting you with your request. I'll search for landmarks and then check the other preferences.
User: [message] That's alright, I appreciate your help! Please let me know what landmarks you find, and if there are any options that fit my preferences, especially those with outdoor seating and vegetarian options.
