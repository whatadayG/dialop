User: \[message] I'm looking for outdoor seating places with high ratings, preferably above 4. I'd like to check out Einstein's summer house and The Tower, and I'm interested in hidden spots with panoramic city views. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a plus. My budget is $70, and I'd like to minimize travel distance.
