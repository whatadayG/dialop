User: \[message] Hi there! I'm planning a trip and would love some help. I'm particularly interested in visiting hidden spots rather than tourist traps. I'd like to check out some live music and definitely want to visit the City Museum of Art. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a plus. We're a group of 7, so places that are good for groups would be ideal. Also, if there are any shops nearby, that would be great!
