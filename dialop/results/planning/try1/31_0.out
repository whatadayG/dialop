User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip and would love to check out some landmarks and hidden spots. I'd like to visit Taqueria y Mas and Saul's, and I'm looking for places with outdoor seating. Preferably, I'd like to avoid live music venues and stick to places with ratings above 4. Also, minimizing travel distance is important to me.
