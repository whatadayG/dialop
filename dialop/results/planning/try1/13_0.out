User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip and would love to visit some places that are good for kids. Outdoor seating is a priority for us, and we prefer takeout options. I'd like to check out Dan's recommendations, Vista Ridge Mall and Market Street. We're renting a car, so parking is important. Also, we're looking for places with ratings above 4.5 and within a $50 budget. We enjoy Japanese, seafood, Chinese, kosher, French, Ethiopian, Korean, and American cuisines.

User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

You: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.

FINAL SCORE: 92/100

USER 2.

User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip and would love to visit some places that are good for kids. Outdoor seating is a priority for us, and we prefer takeout options. I'd like to check out Dan's recommendations, Vista Ridge Mall and Market Street. We're renting a car, so parking is important. Also, we're looking for places with ratings above 4.5 and within a $50 budget. We enjoy Japanese, seafood, Chinese, kosher, French, Ethiopian, Korean, and American cuisines.
You:\[think] The user has specific preferences for their family trip, including kid-friendly places, outdoor seating, takeout options, parking, high ratings, and a budget of $50. They also mentioned specific locations and cuisines. I will start by searching for places that match these criteria and are near the locations they mentioned.
You:\[tool] Search(fields=\[name, category, price, rating, has parking, outdoor seating, good for kids], filters=\[good for kids, has parking, outdoor seating, rating > 4.5, price <= 50], text_query="Japanese OR seafood OR Chinese OR kosher OR French OR Ethiopian OR Korean OR American", sort_by=\[distance_to(Vista Ridge Mall), distance_to(Market Street)], limit=3)
Search Results: No results
You:\[think] It seems there are no results that match all of the user's criteria. I will need to relax some of the filters to find suitable options. I will prioritize kid-friendly places with outdoor seating and parking, and then focus on the cuisines they enjoy. I will also consider places with slightly lower ratings or prices if necessary.

Caribbean Corner also has outdoor seating and is kid-friendly, but lacks parking. All options are within your budget and offer cuisines you enjoy. Let me know what you think!

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
