User: \[message] I'd like to check out some live music and visit either The Dive or Bards n Brews. It would be great to stop by a cafe as well. I'm looking for places rated above 3 stars, with parking, and that are good for groups and kids. Also, I'd prefer takeout options and to keep travel distances short. My budget is $80.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

You:\[think] The proposal includes a cafe and a venue with live music, which are important to me. However, the travel distances are quite long, which is impacting the score negatively. I should consider accepting it since it meets some of my key preferences, but I could also ask the agent to try to reduce the travel distances further.
