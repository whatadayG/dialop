User: [message] Hello! I'm planning a trip to a new city and would love some help with the itinerary. I'm interested in checking out some live music and prefer eating takeout. I have a few cuisine preferences like Korean, kosher, Japanese, and seafood, and I generally like vegan options. Could you help me find some places that fit these preferences?
You: [message] Of course! I'd be happy to help you plan your itinerary. Let's start by finding some places with live music and takeout options that match your cuisine preferences. I'll also look for vegan options. Do you have a budget or any other preferences, like parking or kid-friendly places?
User: [message] Yes, I do have a budget of $30. It would also be great if the places have parking since I'm renting a car. Additionally, I'm on a family trip, so kid-friendly places would be ideal. Thank you for your help!
You: [message] Great! I'll start by searching for places with live music that offer takeout and match your cuisine preferences. I'll also make sure to include vegan options, parking, and kid-friendly places within your budget. Let me find some options for you.
User: [message] Thank you! I'm also interested in seeing some panoramic views of the city, so if you could include any places with great views, that would be wonderful. Looking forward to your suggestions!

User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
