User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip and would like to keep the budget below $90. We're renting a car, so places with parking are preferred. It's a group of 7, so places that are good for groups and kids would be ideal. We prefer takeout and would like to avoid romantic spots. I'm also interested in hidden, non-touristy spots and have heard good things about the Hindenberg Memorial. Could you help me find some options?

You: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
User: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]

USER 2.

User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip and would like to keep the budget below $90. We're renting a car, so places with parking are preferred. It's a group of 7, so places that are good for groups and kids would be ideal. We prefer takeout and would like to avoid romantic spots. I'm also interested in hidden, non-touristy spots and have heard good things about the Hindenberg Memorial. Could you help me find some options?
