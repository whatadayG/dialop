User: [message] I'd like to visit a place with panoramic views of the city and maybe stop by a landmark. I'm also looking for a spot with WiFi to do some work, and I generally prefer vegetarian options. My budget is $30, and I'd like to keep travel distances short. I've heard good things about Liberty Memorial.
You: [message] I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let me continue by searching for a spot with WiFi and vegetarian options near Liberty Memorial.
User: [message] That sounds great! Please let me know what options you find that fit those criteria. I'm particularly interested in places with panoramic views and landmarks, so anything close to Liberty Memorial would be ideal.
