User: \[message] Hi! I'm planning a family trip and I'm looking for some fun activities. I'd love to check out some live music and see hidden, non-touristy spots. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a must. We're a group of 7, so places that are good for groups would be ideal. Can you help me find some great spots?
