User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] I'm interested in visiting places that are rated above 3 stars and have vegetarian or vegan options. I'd like to visit at least one landmark and I've heard good things about the City Museum of Art. I'm renting a car, so parking is important, and I'd like to keep my budget below $30. Could you help me find some options that minimize travel distance?
You: [message] I'm sorry for the confusion earlier. Let's focus on finding the best options for your itinerary. I'll search for places that are rated above 3 stars, have vegetarian or vegan options, and have parking. I'll also include the City Museum of Art and a landmark. Let's see what I can find for you.

You: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
User: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]
You: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
User: [reject]
User: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.
You: [think] I should just look for the closest places to Mad Seoul.
