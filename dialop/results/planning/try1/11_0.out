User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip for a group of 7, and we're looking for places that are good for kids and groups. We'd love to visit Moabit Garden and The Arboretum, and we're interested in classic touristy spots with panoramic city views. Our budget is $90, and we prefer places with ratings above 4.5. Additionally, a place with WiFi would be great for some work. We enjoy Thai, French, American, Spanish, and Chinese cuisines, and we like wine. Please keep the travel distance minimal.

You: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
User: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]
You: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
User: [reject]
User: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.
You: [think] I should just look for the closest places to Mad Seoul.

USER 2.

User: \[message] I'm planning a family trip for a group of 7, and we're looking for places that are good for kids and groups. We'd love to visit Moabit Garden and The Arboretum, and we're interested in classic touristy spots with panoramic city views. Our budget is $90, and we prefer places with ratings above 4.5. Additionally, a place with WiFi would be great for some work. We enjoy Thai, French, American, Spanish, and Chinese cuisines, and we like wine. Please keep the travel distance minimal.
You:\[think] The user has specific preferences for their family trip, including visiting Moabit Garden and The Arboretum, classic touristy spots with city views, a budget of $90, high ratings, WiFi, and specific cuisines. I will start by searching for places that match these criteria and are close to Moabit Garden and The Arboretum.

You:\\\[think\] Liberty Memorial is a landmark that is good for kids and groups, but its rating is exactly 4.5, which doesn't meet the user's preference for ratings above 4.5.
