User: \[message] I'm planning a day in the city and would love to check out some live music. I'm also interested in visiting Liberty Memorial and would like to dine at a restaurant serving Japanese, Spanish, Thai, Korean, or Kosher cuisine. It would be great if the places have parking and are not too far apart. My budget is $50, and I prefer places with a rating above 4.5.
