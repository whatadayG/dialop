User: \[message] I'm planning a day in the city and would love to check out some live music. I'm also interested in visiting Liberty Memorial and would like to dine at a restaurant serving Japanese, Spanish, Thai, Korean, or Kosher cuisine. It would be great if the places have parking and are not too far apart. My budget is $50, and I prefer places with a rating above 4.5.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
You: [think] Concert is not a category I can search by. I should look for a restaurant that is close to Mad Seoul and satisfies the user's preferences as much as possible.
