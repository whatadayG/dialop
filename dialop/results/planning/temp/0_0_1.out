>You are a travel agent. Book a set of three destinations that make the user most happy. Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the final itinerary you proposed matches the user's preferences and how important the preferences are to the user.
Remember, it is expected that you will not be able to satisfy all the user's preferences, so you should ask questions to the user to understand the user's priorities so you can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

You and the user are limited to a fixed number of words in the chat. When the word count is below 0 then you will be forced to make your final proposal, which will be scored. You can also make proposals before the word count is up.

You can use the `Search` tool with the following API:

field: can be name, category, price, info, or any other field of an site
category: can be [restaurant, cafe, museum, bar, landmark, park, shop]
Search:
Parameters
- fields: list of field names to return
- filters: list of filters to intersect with AND. Can only filter one of the
  fields above.
- text_query: freeform text query to search in event descriptions. Will be intersected with filters with AND.
- sort_by: list of fields or callable function to sort results by.
- limit: number of results to return

USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once. When there are multiple options that satisfy different preferences, I will need to ask questions to the user to understand how much they care about each preference so I can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

==================== Final agent Prompt ====================

>You are a travel agent. Book a set of three destinations that make the user most happy. Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the final itinerary you proposed matches the user's preferences and how important the preferences are to the user.
Remember, it is expected that you will not be able to satisfy all the user's preferences, so you should ask questions to the user to understand the user's priorities so you can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

You and the user are limited to a fixed number of words in the chat. When the word count is below 0 then you will be forced to make your final proposal, which will be scored. You can also make proposals before the word count is up.

You can use the `Search` tool with the following API:

field: can be name, category, price, info, or any other field of an site
category: can be [restaurant, cafe, museum, bar, landmark, park, shop]
Search:
Parameters
- fields: list of field names to return
- filters: list of filters to intersect with AND. Can only filter one of the
  fields above.
- text_query: freeform text query to search in event descriptions. Will be intersected with filters with AND.
- sort_by: list of fields or callable function to sort results by.
- limit: number of results to return

User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once. When there are multiple options that satisfy different preferences, I will need to ask questions to the user to understand how much they care about each preference so I can propose the best itinerary that satisfies the user's most important preferences.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

You:[message] I'd like to visit at least one landmark and places with parking. I'm also interested in Dan's recommendations: Central Plaza and The Mall. I prefer places with ratings above 4, vegan options, live music, and kid-friendly. I need a place with wifi to do some work and I'm COVID conscious so outdoor seating would be best. My budget is $40.
Agent: [message] Central Plaza and The Mall both have parking, wifi, and outdoor seating. They are also kid-friendly. However, they do not have live music or vegan options. Would you like to prioritize these features or are there other preferences you would like to prioritize?[message] I think it's important to have vegan options and live music. But I also want to make sure the places are kid-friendly and have parking. Can we find a compromise?
Agent: [message] Central Plaza is a highly rated shop, but it doesn't have parking. Would you still like to visit it?[message] Yes, I think we can make it work without parking. Let's go ahead with Central Plaza.
Agent: [message] The Mall is kid-friendly but it doesn't have parking and its rating is 3. Would you still like to include it in your itinerary?[message] Yes, let's include The Mall as well. We can manage without parking there.
Agent: [message] I found a landmark that might interest you, the Hindenberg Memorial. However, it's not kid-friendly and doesn't have parking. Would you like to include it in your itinerary or should I look for another option?[message] Yes, let's include the Hindenberg Memorial as well. We can manage without it being kid-friendly and having parking.
