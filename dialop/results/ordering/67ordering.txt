To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E > I
   - I < D (which means D > I)
   - D > A
   - A < H (which means H > A)
   - H > F
   - F > J
   - J < C (which means C > J)
   - C < G (which means G > C)
   - G > B

2. From the second list:
   - H < G (which means G > H)
   - G < I (which means I > G)
   - I > J
   - J < D (which means D > J)
   - D > C
   - C > A
   - A > F
   - F < E (which means E > F)
   - E > B

3. From the third list:
   - E > G
   - G < I (which means I > G)
   - I > J
   - J < D (which means D > J)
   - D > F
   - F < H (which means H > F)
   - H > B
   - B < C (which means C > B)
   - C > A

Now, let's consolidate these relationships:

- E is consistently greater than G, F, and B.
- I is consistently greater than G, J, and indirectly greater than C, A, and B.
- D is consistently greater than I, J, C, F, and A.
- G is greater than C, B, and indirectly greater than A.
- H is greater than F, A, and B.
- C is greater than J, A, and B.
- A is consistently less than D, H, C, and indirectly less than E, I, and G.
- B is consistently less than E, G, H, C, and indirectly less than D, I, and A.

From these relationships, we can deduce the overall order:

E > I > D > G > H > C > J > F > A > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > I > D > G > H > C > J > F > A > B
