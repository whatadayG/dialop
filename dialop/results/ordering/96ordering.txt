To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - H < B
   - B > G
   - G > D
   - D < E
   - E < F
   - F < J
   - J > A
   - A < C
   - C > I

2. From the second list:
   - F > B
   - B < E
   - E < J
   - J > G
   - G > A
   - A < H
   - H > I
   - I < C
   - C > D

3. From the third list:
   - B > G
   - G > I
   - I < J
   - J > D
   - D < H
   - H < E
   - E < F
   - F > A
   - A < C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we have a chain: H < B > G > D < E < F < J > A < C > I
- From the second list, we have: F > B < E < J > G > A < H > I < C > D
- From the third list, we have: B > G > I < J > D < H < E < F > A < C

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. J is greater than all other items (J > F, J > E, J > C, J > B, J > G, J > D, J > A, J > H, J > I).
2. F is greater than E, B, G, D, A, H, and I, but less than J (F > E, F > B, F > G, F > D, F > A, F > H, F > I).
3. E is greater than B, G, D, A, H, and I, but less than F and J (E > B, E > G, E > D, E > A, E > H, E > I).
4. C is greater than B, G, D, A, H, and I, but less than J, F, and E (C > B, C > G, C > D, C > A, C > H, C > I).
5. B is greater than G, D, A, H, and I, but less than J, F, E, and C (B > G, B > D, B > A, B > H, B > I).
6. G is greater than D, A, H, and I, but less than J, F, E, C, and B (G > D, G > A, G > H, G > I).
7. D is greater than A, H, and I, but less than J, F, E, C, B, and G (D > A, D > H, D > I).
8. A is greater than H and I, but less than J, F, E, C, B, G, and D (A > H, A > I).
9. H is greater than I, but less than J, F, E, C, B, G, D, and A (H > I).
10. I is less than all other items.

Therefore, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

J > F > E > C > B > G > D > A > H > I
