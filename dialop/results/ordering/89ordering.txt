To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > I > E < F > C < H < J > G > D > B
   - Rearranging gives: A > I > F > E > J > H > C > G > D > B

2. From the second list:
   - H > B < F > C < A > D < G > I > E < J
   - Rearranging gives: F > A > G > I > J > H > C > D > E > B

3. From the third list:
   - D < A < F > I < H < G > C > E > B < J
   - Rearranging gives: F > A > G > H > I > C > J > E > D > B

Now, let's combine these rankings to find a consistent overall order:

- F appears consistently as one of the top items.
- A is consistently ranked high, often just below F.
- G is also consistently ranked high, often just below A.
- I and H are usually in the middle, with I often above H.
- J is usually above E, D, and B.
- E, D, and B are often at the bottom, with B consistently being the lowest.

Combining these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

F > A > G > I > H > J > C > E > D > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

F > A > G > I > H > J > C > E > D > B
