To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > A > I > J < E < D > G < C > H < B

2. From the second list:
   - J < A > D < I > H < F > G < B > E < C

3. From the third list:
   - A > E < B > I < F > D > G < J > H < C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have F > A > I > J and C > H < B.
- From the second list, we have A > D < I > H < F and B > E < C.
- From the third list, we have A > E < B > I < F and D > G < J > H.

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. F is greater than A, I, H, and D.
2. A is greater than I, J, D, and E.
3. I is greater than J and H.
4. J is greater than H.
5. D is greater than G.
6. G is less than J.
7. C is greater than H and B.
8. B is greater than E.

Combining all these, we get the overall order:

F > A > I > D > J > G > C > B > E > H

Therefore, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

F > A > I > D > J > G > C > B > E > H
