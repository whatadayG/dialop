To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B < C
   - C > A
   - A < G
   - G > I
   - I < E
   - E < J
   - J > F
   - F > D
   - D > H

2. From the second list:
   - H < J
   - J > A
   - A > I
   - I < E
   - E < G
   - G > D
   - D < B
   - B < C
   - C > F

3. From the third list:
   - F < B
   - B < C
   - C > J
   - J > H
   - H < D
   - D > E
   - E < G
   - G > I
   - I < A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that C is consistently greater than B, A, J, F, and others, suggesting C is one of the largest.
- J is greater than A, H, and F, but less than C.
- G is greater than A, I, D, and E, but less than C.
- E is less than G and J, but greater than I.
- A is less than C, J, and G, but greater than I.
- I is less than A, E, and G.
- F is less than J and C, but greater than D.
- D is less than G and B, but greater than H.
- H is less than J and D.
- B is less than C, but greater than D and F.

By combining these insights, we can deduce the overall order:

C > J > G > A > E > I > B > F > D > H

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

C > J > G > A > E > I > B > F > D > H
