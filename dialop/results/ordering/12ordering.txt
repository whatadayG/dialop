To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - D < A
   - A > B
   - B > G
   - G < I
   - I > F
   - F < J
   - J < H
   - H > E
   - E < C

2. From the second list:
   - I > D
   - D < E
   - E < A
   - A > C
   - C > B
   - B > G
   - G < F
   - F < J
   - J < H

3. From the third list:
   - F < E
   - E < A
   - A > D
   - D > G
   - G < B
   - B < C
   - C > I
   - I < H
   - H > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that A is greater than D, B, E, and C.
- C is greater than B, I, and E.
- H is greater than J, I, and E.
- J is greater than F.
- F is greater than G.
- I is greater than D and F.
- E is greater than D and F.
- B is greater than G.

By combining these, we can deduce the overall order:

H > A > C > I > J > E > B > F > D > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > A > C > I > J > E > B > F > D > G
