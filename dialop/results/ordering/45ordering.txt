To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists and deduce the relative positions of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > A > I > F < G < D > J < H > E > C

2. From the second list:
   - E > D > F > C < G > J < H > B > A > I

3. From the third list:
   - G > J < I < B < H > A > E > C < D > F

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we see B > A, A > I, I > F, F < G, G < D, D > J, J < H, H > E, E > C.
- From the second list, we see E > D, D > F, F > C, C < G, G > J, J < H, H > B, B > A, A > I.
- From the third list, we see G > J, J < I, I < B, B < H, H > A, A > E, E > C, C < D, D > F.

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. H is greater than B, A, E, and others.
2. B is greater than A, I, and others.
3. A is greater than I, E, and others.
4. E is greater than D, C, and others.
5. G is greater than J, F, C, and others.
6. D is greater than F, J, C, and others.
7. J is less than G, D, and others but greater than I.
8. I is less than B, J, and others.
9. F is less than D, G, and others.
10. C is less than E, F, D, and others.

By carefully analyzing these relationships, we can establish the overall order:

H > B > A > E > D > G > J > I > F > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > B > A > E > D > G > J > I > F > C
