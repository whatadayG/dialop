To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists and deduce the relative positions of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < G
   - G > H
   - H > B
   - B > C
   - C < D
   - D > J
   - J > F
   - F < E
   - E < I

2. From the second list:
   - A < E
   - E < D
   - D > J
   - J > C
   - C > F
   - F < I
   - I < B
   - B < G
   - G > H

3. From the third list:
   - F < D
   - D > B
   - B < J
   - J > A
   - A < E
   - E < I
   - I > C
   - C < H
   - H < G

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From all lists, G is consistently greater than H, B, A, and C.
- D is consistently greater than J, B, C, and F.
- I is consistently greater than E, F, and C.
- E is consistently greater than A and F.
- J is consistently greater than A and C.
- B is consistently greater than C.
- H is consistently greater than C.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

G > H > B > J > D > I > E > A > F > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > D > I > E > J > H > B > A > F > C
