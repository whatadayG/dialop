To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - D > B > A < G > C < I > F > J < E < H

2. From the second list:
   - C < E < D > J < G < I < H > A < B < F

3. From the third list:
   - G < H > F > A < E > J < D > C < B < I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have D > B and D > J.
- From the second list, we have D > J and D > C.
- From the third list, we have D > C.

- From the first list, we have H > E and H > I.
- From the second list, we have H > I and H > A.
- From the third list, we have H > G and H > F.

- From the first list, we have G > C and G > A.
- From the second list, we have G < I and G > J.
- From the third list, we have G < H and G > J.

- From the first list, we have I > F and I > C.
- From the second list, we have I < H and I > G.
- From the third list, we have I > B.

- From the first list, we have F > J and F > A.
- From the second list, we have F > B.
- From the third list, we have F > A.

- From the first list, we have E < H and E > J.
- From the second list, we have E < D and E > A.
- From the third list, we have E > J.

- From the first list, we have B > A.
- From the second list, we have B < F.
- From the third list, we have B < I.

- From the first list, we have J < E.
- From the second list, we have J < G.
- From the third list, we have J < D.

Combining all these, we can deduce the overall order:

H > D > I > F > B > G > E > C > J > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > D > I > F > B > G > E > C > J > A
