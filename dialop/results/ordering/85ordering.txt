To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - J > E > C < F < D > B > H < G > A < I

2. From the second list:
   - F > C < D > A < J > H < G > B > E < I

3. From the third list:
   - D > G > E > C < F > B > J > A < I > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the item that appears most frequently as the largest in the comparisons: D.
- From the third list, D > G, and from the first list, D > B, so D > G > B.
- From the second list, D > A, and from the third list, D > G > E, so D > G > E > A.
- From the first list, D > B > H, and from the second list, D > A < J, so D > G > E > A < J > H.
- From the third list, D > G > E > C < F, and from the second list, F > C, so D > G > E > C < F.
- From the first list, D > B > H < G, and from the second list, G > B > E, so D > G > B > E.
- From the third list, D > G > E > C < F > B, and from the second list, F > C < D, so D > G > E > C < F > B.
- From the first list, J > E > C < F < D, and from the second list, J > H < G, so J > E > C < F < D.
- From the third list, D > G > E > C < F > B > J, and from the second list, J > H < G, so J > H < G > E > C < F > B.
- From the first list, J > E > C < F < D > B > H < G > A < I, and from the second list, A < J > H < G, so J > H < G > A < I.
- From the third list, I > H, and from the second list, I > H, so I > H.

Combining all these deductions, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > J > D > G > F > E > C > B > A > H
