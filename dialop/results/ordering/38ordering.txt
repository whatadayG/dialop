To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative positions of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B < J < H > F > G < D > A > C < E > I

2. From the second list:
   - D > F < H > B < E > A > G < I < J > C

3. From the third list:
   - G < I > C < E > A > B < J < H > F < D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have: J > H > F > G and D > A > C
- From the second list, we have: H > B and E > A > G
- From the third list, we have: I > C and J > H

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. H is greater than B, F, and J.
2. J is greater than B and C.
3. D is greater than F, A, and G.
4. E is greater than A and B.
5. I is greater than C and G.

By combining all these observations, we can construct the overall order:

H > J > D > E > I > F > A > B > G > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > J > D > E > I > F > A > B > G > C
