To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > H
   - H < C (which means C > H)
   - C > F
   - F < G (which means G > F)
   - G > J
   - J < D (which means D > J)
   - D < E (which means E > D)
   - E < I (which means I > E)
   - I > A

2. From the second list:
   - B > I
   - I > F
   - F < E (which means E > F)
   - E > H
   - H > J
   - J < G (which means G > J)
   - G < A (which means A > G)
   - A < C (which means C > A)
   - C > D

3. From the third list:
   - H > D
   - D > J
   - J < F (which means F > J)
   - F < G (which means G > F)
   - G < A (which means A > G)
   - A < B (which means B > A)
   - B < C (which means C > B)
   - C > I
   - I > E

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can deduce that C is greater than many items: C > H, C > F, C > D, C > A, C > B, C > I.
- B is greater than H, I, and A, but less than C.
- I is greater than F, E, and A, but less than B and C.
- E is greater than D, F, and H, but less than I.
- G is greater than F, J, and H, but less than A.
- A is greater than G, but less than B and C.
- D is greater than J, but less than E, H, and C.
- F is greater than J, but less than C, G, I, and E.
- H is greater than D and J, but less than B, C, and E.
- J is the smallest as it is less than D, F, G, and H.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

C > B > I > E > A > G > H > F > D > J
