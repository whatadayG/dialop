To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C < G < J > F > A < E > I > H > D < B

2. From the second list:
   - D < C < J > F > I < G > A < B > H < E

3. From the third list:
   - F < B > C > D < G > A < H < I < J < E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the largest item, which appears to be E, as it is greater than A, I, and H in the first list, and greater than H in the second list.
- Next, J is consistently shown to be greater than F, I, and C.
- B is shown to be greater than C, D, F, and A.
- G is greater than C, A, and D.
- F is greater than A and D.
- I is greater than H and D.
- C is greater than D.
- A is greater than D.
- H is greater than D.

Combining these insights, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

E > J > B > G > F > I > C > A > H > D
