To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking of the items.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - H > B > E < C > F < I > J < A < G > D

2. From the second list:
   - F < B > E < D < I > H > G > J < C < A

3. From the third list:
   - F < I > H > G > J > E < A > B < C > D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is consistently ranked higher than many other items (F, H, D, E, J), suggesting it is one of the largest.
- H is consistently ranked higher than B, G, J, and E, but lower than I.
- G is ranked higher than J, D, and E, but lower than H and I.
- A is ranked higher than B, C, and E, but lower than I.
- C is ranked higher than D, F, and J, but lower than A and I.
- B is ranked higher than E, F, and J, but lower than A, C, H, and I.
- E is ranked higher than F and J, but lower than A, B, C, D, G, H, and I.
- F is ranked higher than J, but lower than A, B, C, D, E, G, H, and I.
- J is consistently ranked lower than most other items.

By synthesizing these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

I > H > G > A > C > B > D > E > F > J

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > H > G > A > C > B > D > E > F > J
