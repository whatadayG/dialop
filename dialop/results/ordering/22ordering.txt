To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent order that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > F > C < I > H < J > G > A < D > E

2. From the second list:
   - G < J > C < I > D < B > A > E > H < F

3. From the third list:
   - F < D < J > H < G > C < B > E < A < I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have: B > F > C < I > H < J > G > A < D > E
- From the second list, we have: B > D > I > J > G > C > F > H > A > E
- From the third list, we have: I > A > B > C > G > J > D > F > E > H

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

I > B > D > J > G > C > F > A > E > H

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > B > D > J > G > C > F > A > E > H
