To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking of the items.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > I
   - I < G (implies G > I)
   - G > D
   - D < F (implies F > D)
   - F > A
   - A < J (implies J > A)
   - J > H
   - H > E
   - E < C (implies C > E)

2. From the second list:
   - I < B (implies B > I)
   - B < G (implies G > B)
   - G > A
   - A < F (implies F > A)
   - F > C
   - C > H
   - H > E
   - E < J (implies J > E)
   - J > D

3. From the third list:
   - D < G (implies G > D)
   - G > B
   - B < C (implies C > B)
   - C > H
   - H < F (implies F > H)
   - F > A
   - A < J (implies J > A)
   - J > E
   - E > I

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons to find the overall order:

- G is consistently greater than B, I, D, A, and F.
- F is consistently greater than D, A, C, H, and E.
- J is consistently greater than A, E, D, and H.
- C is consistently greater than B, H, and E.
- B is consistently greater than I.
- H is consistently greater than E.
- E is consistently greater than I.

From these observations, we can deduce the following order:

G > F > J > C > B > H > E > D > A > I

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > F > J > C > B > H > E > D > A > I
