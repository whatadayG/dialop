To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E > A
   - A < J (J > A)
   - J > D
   - D > G
   - G < I (I > G)
   - I < H (H > I)
   - H > C
   - C > F
   - F < B (B > F)

2. From the second list:
   - H > J
   - J < E (E > J)
   - E > C
   - C > G
   - G < F (F > G)
   - F > D
   - D < B (B > D)
   - B > A
   - A < I (I > A)

3. From the third list:
   - F > G
   - G < B (B > G)
   - B > A
   - A < J (J > A)
   - J > C
   - C < H (H > C)
   - H > I
   - I > E
   - E > D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that H is consistently greater than many items (H > J, H > C, H > I).
- E is also consistently greater than many items (E > A, E > J, E > C, E > D).
- B is greater than several items (B > F, B > D, B > A, B > G).
- J is greater than A, D, and C.
- I is greater than G and A.
- F is greater than G and D.
- C is greater than F and G.
- D is greater than G.
- A is the smallest in many comparisons.

Considering these observations, we can deduce the following order:

H > E > J > B > I > C > F > D > G > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > E > J > B > I > C > F > D > G > A
