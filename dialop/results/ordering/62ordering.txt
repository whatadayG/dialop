To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - J < G
   - G > A
   - A < I
   - I > B
   - B < F
   - F < C
   - C < H
   - H > D
   - D < E

2. From the second list:
   - I > B
   - B < C
   - C < H
   - H > D
   - D < G
   - G > A
   - A < E
   - E > J
   - J < F

3. From the third list:
   - A > D
   - D < F
   - F > B
   - B < E
   - E < G
   - G > J
   - J < H
   - H > I
   - I < C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we can deduce: E > H > C > F > B > I > A > G > J > D
- From the second list, we can deduce: E > G > A > D > H > C > F > J > I > B
- From the third list, we can deduce: G > E > A > F > D > H > J > I > C > B

By combining these deductions, we can establish the overall order:

G > E > H > C > F > I > A > J > D > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > E > H > C > F > I > A > J > D > B
