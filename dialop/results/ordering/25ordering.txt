To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > A
   - A < F (which means F > A)
   - F < C (which means C > F)
   - C > E
   - E < H (which means H > E)
   - H > D
   - D < G (which means G > D)
   - G < J (which means J > G)
   - J > I

2. From the second list:
   - D < G (which means G > D)
   - G > E
   - E > A
   - A < J (which means J > A)
   - J > F
   - F < B (which means B > F)
   - B > H
   - H > I
   - I < C (which means C > I)

3. From the third list:
   - E < H (which means H > E)
   - H < C (which means C > H)
   - C > G
   - G < J (which means J > G)
   - J > F
   - F < B (which means B > F)
   - B > D
   - D < I (which means I > D)
   - I > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to determine the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that J is consistently greater than many other items (A, F, G, I), suggesting it is one of the largest.
- C is also consistently greater than many items (F, E, H, I, G), suggesting it is quite large as well.
- B is greater than F, H, D, and A, placing it high in the order.
- G is greater than D and E, but less than J and C.
- H is greater than E, D, and I, but less than C and B.
- F is greater than A, but less than J, C, and B.
- E is greater than A, but less than H, G, and C.
- D is less than G, B, H, and I.
- I is greater than D and A, but less than J and C.
- A is consistently one of the smallest items.

Combining all these insights, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

J > C > B > G > H > F > E > I > D > A
