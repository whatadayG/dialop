To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists and deduce the relative ranking of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F < G
   - G > B
   - B < H
   - H > J
   - J > I
   - I < C
   - C > E
   - E > D
   - D < A

2. From the second list:
   - G > F
   - F > I
   - I < C
   - C > D
   - D < A
   - A > E
   - E < H
   - H > J
   - J > B

3. From the third list:
   - H > I
   - I < E
   - E < C
   - C < G
   - G > J
   - J > B
   - B > D
   - D < F
   - F < A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that A is greater than F, D, E, and J.
- G is greater than F, B, J, and C.
- H is greater than I, J, E, and B.
- C is greater than E, I, and D.
- E is greater than D and I.
- F is greater than I and D.
- J is greater than B and I.
- B is greater than D.

By combining these, we can deduce the overall order:

A > G > H > C > F > E > J > B > D > I

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

A > G > H > C > F > E > J > B > D > I
