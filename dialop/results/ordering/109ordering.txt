To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I > F > G < B > D < E > H < A < J < C

2. From the second list:
   - E > J < C > F < B < I > A < G > D < H

3. From the third list:
   - G < J < C > D < B > F > H < A < E < I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have: C > J > A > H > E > D > B > G > F > I
- From the second list, we have: C > J > E > A > I > B > F > G > D > H
- From the third list, we have: C > J > E > A > I > B > F > G > D > H

By combining these, we can deduce the overall order:

C > J > E > A > I > B > F > G > D > H

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

C > J > E > A > I > B > F > G > D > H
