To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent ordering that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < I
   - I > J
   - J < A
   - A < C
   - C < G
   - G > F
   - F > D
   - D < B
   - B > H

2. From the second list:
   - E < B
   - B > D
   - D > J
   - J < I
   - I < C
   - C < G
   - G > H
   - H < F
   - F > A

3. From the third list:
   - H < B
   - B > I
   - I < G
   - G > A
   - A < C
   - C > E
   - E < F
   - F > D
   - D > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is consistently greater than most other items (G > C, G > F, G > H, G > A, G > I).
- C is consistently greater than A, E, and I.
- B is consistently greater than D, H, J, and I.
- F is greater than E, D, A, and H.
- A is less than C and G but greater than J.
- E is less than F, C, and B.
- D is less than B and F but greater than J.
- J is consistently less than I, A, and D.

By organizing these relationships, we can deduce the following order:

G > C > F > B > I > A > E > D > J > H

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > C > F > B > I > A > E > D > J > H
