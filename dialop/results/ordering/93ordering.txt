To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I < F
   - F > G
   - G < B
   - B > A
   - A < C
   - C > J
   - J < H
   - H > D
   - D < E

2. From the second list:
   - E > I
   - I < C
   - C > G
   - G > J
   - J < D
   - D < A
   - A < B
   - B < H
   - H > F

3. From the third list:
   - G < E
   - E < F
   - F > D
   - D < H
   - H > C
   - C < B
   - B > A
   - A > J
   - J < I

Now, let's deduce the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that F is greater than I, G, D, and E.
- H is greater than F, C, D, and B.
- C is greater than G, J, and I.
- B is greater than A, G, and C.
- E is greater than I and G.
- A is greater than J.
- J is less than I.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

H > F > E > B > C > A > G > D > I > J

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > F > E > B > C > A > G > D > I > J
