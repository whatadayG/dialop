To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > D
   - D < E (which means E > D)
   - E > H
   - H < C (which means C > H)
   - C < J (which means J > C)
   - J < I (which means I > J)
   - I > F
   - F > G
   - G < B (which means B > G)

2. From the second list:
   - E < A (which means A > E)
   - A > F
   - F > D
   - D > J
   - J < B (which means B > J)
   - B > G
   - G > H
   - H < I (which means I > H)
   - I > C

3. From the third list:
   - H < A (which means A > H)
   - A > E
   - E < F (which means F > E)
   - F > D
   - D > C
   - C < G (which means G > C)
   - G < B (which means B > G)
   - B < I (which means I > B)
   - I > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to determine the overall order:

- A is consistently greater than E, F, D, H, and others, indicating it is one of the largest.
- I is consistently greater than J, C, H, B, and others, indicating it is also one of the largest.
- B is greater than G, J, and others, but less than I.
- F is greater than E, D, and others, but less than A and I.
- E is greater than D and H, but less than A and F.
- D is greater than J and C, but less than A, E, and F.
- J is less than B and I, but greater than C.
- C is less than J, G, and I, but greater than H.
- G is less than B, but greater than C.
- H is less than A, E, C, and I.

Considering all these comparisons, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

A > I > B > F > E > D > G > J > C > H
