To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C < D
   - D > G
   - G < F
   - F > J
   - J > A
   - A < E
   - E > B
   - B > H
   - H < I

2. From the second list:
   - A < G
   - G < J
   - J > B
   - B < I
   - I > F
   - F > H
   - H < C
   - C < D
   - D > E

3. From the third list:
   - J > C
   - C < F
   - F < I
   - I > E
   - E > B
   - B < G
   - G < D
   - D > H
   - H > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is consistently greater than many other items (F, E, B, H, A), suggesting it is one of the largest.
- D is also consistently greater than many items (C, G, E, H), suggesting it is near the top.
- J is greater than C, B, A, and is only less than F and I in some comparisons, suggesting it is also near the top.
- F is greater than J, C, H, and less than I, suggesting it is also near the top.
- E is greater than B, A, and less than I, D, suggesting it is in the middle.
- G is less than D, J, and greater than B, A, suggesting it is in the middle.
- C is less than D, F, J, and greater than H, suggesting it is in the lower middle.
- B is less than J, I, G, E, and greater than H, suggesting it is near the bottom.
- H is less than C, F, I, D, and greater than A, suggesting it is near the bottom.
- A is less than J, G, E, B, H, suggesting it is the smallest.

Combining these insights, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > D > J > F > E > G > C > B > H > A
