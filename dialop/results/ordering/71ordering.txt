To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G > H
   - H < F (which means F > H)
   - F < D (which means D > F)
   - D < E (which means E > D)
   - E > A
   - A < I (which means I > A)
   - I > B
   - B > C
   - C < J (which means J > C)

2. From the second list:
   - E > I
   - I > A
   - A > H
   - H < J (which means J > H)
   - J > C
   - C < F (which means F > C)
   - F < B (which means B > F)
   - B > G
   - G < D (which means D > G)

3. From the third list:
   - A > H
   - H < J (which means J > H)
   - J < G (which means G > J)
   - G < F (which means F > G)
   - F < D (which means D > F)
   - D > B
   - B < I (which means I > B)
   - I < E (which means E > I)
   - E > C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From E > I, E > D, E > A, and E > C, we know E is one of the largest.
- From I > A, I > B, and I > H, we know I is larger than A, B, and H.
- From D > F, D > G, and D > B, we know D is larger than F, G, and B.
- From F > H, F > C, and F > G, we know F is larger than H, C, and G.
- From J > C and J > H, we know J is larger than C and H.
- From B > G and B > C, we know B is larger than G and C.

Combining all these, we can deduce the overall order:

E > I > D > B > F > G > J > A > H > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > I > D > B > F > G > J > A > H > C
