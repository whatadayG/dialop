To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < C
   - C > D
   - D > J
   - J < H
   - H > B
   - B < E
   - E < G
   - G > I
   - I > F

2. From the second list:
   - J > F
   - F < C
   - C > A
   - A > H
   - H < E
   - E < G
   - G > B
   - B > I
   - I < D

3. From the third list:
   - E > F
   - F < C
   - C > I
   - I < A
   - A > B
   - B < D
   - D > H
   - H > J
   - J < G

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is greater than E, which is greater than F, and G is also greater than J, H, B, and I.
- C is greater than A, D, I, and F.
- E is greater than F, H, and B.
- D is greater than H, J, and B.
- A is greater than H and B.
- H is greater than J.
- B is greater than I.
- J is greater than F.

By combining these insights, we can deduce the overall order:

G > C > E > D > A > H > J > B > I > F

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > C > E > D > A > H > J > B > I > F
