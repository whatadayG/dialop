To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - J > D
   - D < C
   - C < B
   - B > G
   - G < H
   - H > A
   - A < F
   - F < E
   - E > I

2. From the second list:
   - J < B
   - B > D
   - D < F
   - F > A
   - A < E
   - E > G
   - G > I
   - I < H
   - H > C

3. From the third list:
   - A < J
   - J < F
   - F < I
   - I > C
   - C > D
   - D < H
   - H > G
   - G < E
   - E > B

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we have a partial order: J > D < C < B > G < H > A < F < E > I
- From the second list, we have: J < B > D < F > A < E > G > I < H > C
- From the third list, we have: A < J < F < I > C > D < H > G < E > B

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. E is consistently greater than most other items.
2. F is greater than A and less than E.
3. J is less than B and greater than D.
4. H is greater than C, G, and D.
5. B is greater than J, D, and C.
6. I is less than E and greater than C.
7. G is less than B and greater than I.
8. A is less than F and greater than none of the others.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

E > F > J > B > H > I > C > D > G > A
