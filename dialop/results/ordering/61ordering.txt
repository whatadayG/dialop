To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and establish a consistent ranking.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < G < H > A > D > B < F > C < I > J

2. From the second list:
   - H > E < G < C < I > D > B < J < A < F

3. From the third list:
   - H > B < D > G < I > J < F > C > E < A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- H is consistently greater than E, B, and A.
- I is consistently greater than J, D, and C.
- F is consistently greater than B, C, and J.
- A is greater than E and J.
- G is less than H and I, but greater than E and D.
- C is less than F and I, but greater than E.
- D is greater than B and less than A and I.
- J is consistently less than I, F, and A.
- E is consistently less than H, G, and A.

By combining these observations, we can establish the following order:

H > I > F > A > G > D > C > E > B > J

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > I > F > A > G > D > C > E > B > J
