To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < F
   - F > H
   - H < G
   - G > D
   - D > I
   - I > J
   - J < B
   - B > C
   - C > A

2. From the second list:
   - J < B
   - B > A
   - A > E
   - E < D
   - D > I
   - I > H
   - H < F
   - F > C
   - C < G

3. From the third list:
   - H < F
   - F > J
   - J < D
   - D > E
   - E < C
   - C < G
   - G > I
   - I < A
   - A < B

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that B is consistently greater than many other items (J, A, E, etc.).
- G is also consistently greater than many items (H, C, I, etc.).
- F is greater than H and J, and also greater than C.
- D is greater than E, I, and J.
- C is greater than A and E, but less than G and F.
- A is less than B and greater than I.
- E is less than D and C, but greater than F in some comparisons.
- I is less than D and greater than J.
- J is less than B and D.

By synthesizing these comparisons, we can deduce the following order:

B > G > F > D > C > A > I > E > H > J

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

B > G > F > D > C > A > I > E > H > J
