To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of inequalities and find a consistent order that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F < B < C > I < D < H > G < A > J < E

2. From the second list:
   - F < B < D > G < J < E > C > A > I < H

3. From the third list:
   - E > C > D > I < A > G < J > F < B < H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- E is greater than C, D, J, F, B, and H.
- C is greater than D, I, A, G, J, F, and B.
- D is greater than I, G, J, F, and B.
- A is greater than G, J, F, and B.
- H is greater than G, J, F, and B.
- B is greater than F.

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

E > C > D > H > A > B > I > G > J > F

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > C > D > H > A > B > I > G > J > F
