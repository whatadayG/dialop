To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > J
   - J < E
   - E > G
   - G < C
   - C > F
   - F > D
   - D > H
   - H > I
   - I < B

2. From the second list:
   - I < G
   - G > D
   - D < F
   - F > H
   - H < B
   - B > J
   - J < E
   - E < C
   - C > A

3. From the third list:
   - H < F
   - F > G
   - G < J
   - J < C
   - C > B
   - B > I
   - I < A
   - A > D
   - D < E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that C is consistently ranked higher than many other items (C > A, C > B, C > F, C > J, C > E, C > G).
- A is ranked higher than J, D, and I, but lower than C.
- B is ranked higher than I, J, H, and D, but lower than C.
- E is ranked higher than J, G, and D, but lower than C.
- F is ranked higher than G, D, and H, but lower than C.
- G is ranked higher than D and I, but lower than E, F, and C.
- J is ranked lower than A, B, C, and E, but higher than G.
- D is ranked lower than A, B, E, F, and G, but higher than H.
- H is ranked lower than B, F, and D, but higher than I.
- I is ranked lower than A, B, G, and H.

Based on these deductions, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

C > A > B > E > F > G > J > D > H > I
