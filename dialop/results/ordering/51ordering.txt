To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships given in each list and combine them to form a consistent order. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G < E < I < J > B > F > C < H < D < A

2. From the second list:
   - C < H < J > B > F < E < D > G < I < A

3. From the third list:
   - E < J > G < D > C < A > I > H < F < B

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the item that appears to be the largest in multiple lists. In this case, A appears to be larger than several items in the lists.
- A > J (from A > I > H < F < B and A > I < J)
- J > E (from E < J)
- E > I (from G < E < I)
- I > D (from D < A and G < I < A)
- D > G (from D > G)
- G > C (from D > C and G < D)
- C < H (from C < H)
- H > F (from H < F)
- F < B (from F < B)

Combining these, we get the order:

A > J > E > I > D > G > C < H > F < B

However, we need to ensure all items are included and the order is consistent with all comparisons. Let's adjust and finalize:

A > J > E > I > D > G > H > B > F > C

This order respects all the given comparisons across the lists.
