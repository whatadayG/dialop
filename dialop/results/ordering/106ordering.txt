To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I < B < A > G < D > F < E > H < C < J

2. From the second list:
   - I < D > C < A > E > J > H > G < F < B

3. From the third list:
   - I < B < A > G < C < J < E > H > F < D

Now, let's try to find a consistent order:

- Start with the item that appears to be the largest in most comparisons. A is consistently larger than many other items.
- Next, B is consistently smaller than A but larger than many others.
- D is larger than C and F in multiple comparisons.
- E is larger than H and J in multiple comparisons.
- J is larger than C and H in multiple comparisons.
- C is larger than H and G in multiple comparisons.
- F is smaller than D and larger than G in multiple comparisons.
- H is smaller than E and larger than G in multiple comparisons.
- G is smaller than A and larger than I in multiple comparisons.
- I is consistently the smallest.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

A > B > D > E > J > C > H > F > G > I
