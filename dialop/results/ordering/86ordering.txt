To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < G
   - G > C
   - C < H
   - H < D
   - D < J
   - J > B
   - B < I
   - I > F
   - F > A

2. From the second list:
   - D > F
   - F > E
   - E > B
   - B < C
   - C > A
   - A < J
   - J > I
   - I > G
   - G > H

3. From the third list:
   - G > E
   - E > B
   - B < J
   - J > F
   - F > H
   - H < I
   - I > A
   - A < D
   - D > C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that J is consistently greater than many other items (D, B, F, I, A).
- I is greater than F, G, A, and H.
- G is greater than E, C, and H.
- D is greater than F, C, and A.
- F is greater than E, H, and A.
- E is greater than B.
- C is greater than A.
- H is less than I and F.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

J > I > G > D > F > E > C > H > B > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > I > G > D > F > E > C > H > B > A
