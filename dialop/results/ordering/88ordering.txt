To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < A
   - A > I
   - I > F
   - F > G
   - G < J
   - J > B
   - B > D
   - D < C
   - C > H

2. From the second list:
   - B < I
   - I < A
   - A > J
   - J < C
   - C > F
   - F < E
   - E > D
   - D < H
   - H > G

3. From the third list:
   - B < J
   - J < C
   - C > H
   - H < F
   - F < I
   - I < A
   - A > G
   - G < D
   - D < E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that A is consistently greater than most other items (A > I, A > J, A > G).
- C is also consistently greater than many items (C > H, C > F, C > J).
- E is greater than D and F, but less than A.
- I is less than A but greater than B and F.
- J is less than A and C but greater than B and G.
- B is less than I and J but greater than D.
- D is less than C, E, and H but greater than G.
- H is less than C and F but greater than G.
- F is less than I and C but greater than G.
- G is less than F, J, and D.

Based on these observations, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

A > C > I > J > E > F > H > B > D > G
