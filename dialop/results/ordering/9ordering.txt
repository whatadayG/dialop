To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - D > G
   - G < C (which implies C > G)
   - C > F
   - F < E (which implies E > F)
   - E < I (which implies I > E)
   - I < A (which implies A > I)
   - A > H
   - H > B
   - B < J (which implies J > B)

2. From the second list:
   - B < A (which implies A > B)
   - A > C
   - C < D (which implies D > C)
   - D > G
   - G < F (which implies F > G)
   - F < H (which implies H > F)
   - H > J
   - J > I
   - I > E

3. From the third list:
   - H > F
   - F < A (which implies A > F)
   - A > G
   - G < J (which implies J > G)
   - J > C
   - C < B (which implies B > C)
   - B > E
   - E < I (which implies I > E)
   - I < D (which implies D > I)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that D is consistently greater than many other items (D > G, D > C, D > I), suggesting D is one of the largest.
- A is also consistently greater than many items (A > I, A > H, A > C, A > F, A > G), suggesting A is also very large.
- J is greater than several items (J > B, J > I, J > C, J > G), suggesting J is also large.
- H is greater than several items (H > B, H > F, H > J), suggesting H is also large.

Considering these observations, let's try to construct the order:

1. D (since D > C, D > I, D > G)
2. A (since A > I, A > H, A > C, A > F, A > G)
3. J (since J > B, J > I, J > C, J > G)
4. H (since H > B, H > F, H > J)
5. C (since C > G, C > F, C > B)
6. F (since F > G, F > E)
7. G (since G > E)
8. I (since I > E)
9. B (since B > E)
10. E

Thus, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

D > A > J > H > C > F > G > I > B > E
