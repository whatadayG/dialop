To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > I
   - I < D (which means D > I)
   - D > J
   - J < C (which means C > J)
   - C > B
   - B < E (which means E > B)
   - E > G
   - G > H
   - H < A (which means A > H)

2. From the second list:
   - C > A
   - A > H
   - H < D (which means D > H)
   - D < F (which means F > D)
   - F > I
   - I > J
   - J < E (which means E > J)
   - E > G
   - G > B

3. From the third list:
   - F > I
   - I < E (which means E > I)
   - E > B
   - B < G (which means G > B)
   - G < C (which means C > G)
   - C > J
   - J < D (which means D > J)
   - D > A
   - A > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- F is greater than I, D, and A (from F > I, F > D, and F > A).
- E is greater than I, J, B, and G (from E > I, E > J, E > B, and E > G).
- C is greater than J, B, G, and A (from C > J, C > B, C > G, and C > A).
- D is greater than I, J, A, and H (from D > I, D > J, D > A, and D > H).
- A is greater than H.
- G is greater than B and H.

From these deductions, we can establish the following order:

F > E > C > D > A > G > I > J > B > H

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

F > E > C > D > A > G > I > J > B > H
