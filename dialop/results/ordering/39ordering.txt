To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent ordering that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G > A
   - A < D
   - D < E
   - E < F
   - F > H
   - H < B
   - B > J
   - J < I
   - I > C

2. From the second list:
   - A < B
   - B > H
   - H > E
   - E < I
   - I < F
   - F > D
   - D < C
   - C < G
   - G > J

3. From the third list:
   - J < I
   - I < F
   - F > E
   - E < G
   - G > A
   - A < D
   - D < H
   - H < B
   - B > C

Now, let's try to construct the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is consistently greater than A, J, and C, and also greater than E in the third list. G is also greater than D and C in the second list.
- F is consistently greater than E, D, and H, and also greater than I in the second and third lists.
- B is consistently greater than H, J, and C, and also greater than A in the second list.
- I is consistently greater than J and C.
- E is consistently less than F and G, but greater than D in the first list.
- D is consistently less than F, E, and H, but greater than A in the first list.
- H is consistently less than F and B, but greater than E in the second list.
- A is consistently less than G, B, and D.
- J is consistently less than B and I.
- C is consistently less than G, B, and I.

Based on these observations, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

G > F > B > I > E > D > H > A > J > C
