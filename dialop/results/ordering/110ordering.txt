To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > G
   - G < H (which implies H > G)
   - H < A (which implies A > H)
   - A < E (which implies E > A)
   - E > D
   - D > F
   - F > J
   - J < C (which implies C > J)
   - C > I

2. From the second list:
   - G < E (which implies E > G)
   - E > A
   - A > D
   - D > I
   - I < F (which implies F > I)
   - F < B (which implies B > F)
   - B > C
   - C > H
   - H > J

3. From the third list:
   - J < F (which implies F > J)
   - F < B (which implies B > F)
   - B > G
   - G < E (which implies E > G)
   - E > D
   - D > I
   - I < C (which implies C > I)
   - C > H
   - H < A (which implies A > H)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that B is consistently greater than many items: B > G, B > F, B > C.
- E is also consistently greater than many items: E > A, E > D, E > G.
- A is greater than H and D.
- C is greater than H, J, and I.
- F is greater than J and I.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

B > E > A > C > F > D > H > G > I > J

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

B > E > A > C > F > D > H > G > I > J
