To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < C
   - C > F
   - F > J
   - J < D
   - D > H
   - H < I
   - I > E
   - E > B
   - B < G

2. From the second list:
   - E > D
   - D > F
   - F < I
   - I > G
   - G < A
   - A > B
   - B > J
   - J > H
   - H < C

3. From the third list:
   - C > A
   - A > B
   - B < G
   - G < E
   - E > H
   - H < D
   - D > F
   - F > J
   - J < I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have a chain: C > F > J < D > H < I > E > B < G < A
- From the second list, we have: E > D > F < I > G < A > B > J > H < C
- From the third list, we have: C > A > B < G < E > H < D > F > J < I

By combining these chains and resolving any conflicts, we can deduce the overall order:

1. I is consistently greater than most other items.
2. C is consistently greater than A, F, J, H, and B.
3. E is consistently greater than D, H, and B.
4. D is consistently greater than F, J, and H.
5. A is consistently greater than B and G.
6. G is consistently greater than B.
7. F is consistently greater than J.
8. J is consistently greater than H.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > C > E > D > F > A > G > B > J > H
