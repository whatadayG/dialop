To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G < C
   - C < B
   - B > E
   - E > I
   - I < J
   - J > A
   - A > D
   - D < H
   - H < F

2. From the second list:
   - E > D
   - D < A
   - A < F
   - F > G
   - G < B
   - B > I
   - I < C
   - C > J
   - J > H

3. From the third list:
   - D < J
   - J < F
   - F > E
   - E > G
   - G < B
   - B > A
   - A < I
   - I > H
   - H < C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can deduce:
  - F is greater than G, E, D, J, A, H, and C.
  - B is greater than G, E, I, A, and C.
  - C is greater than G, I, J, and H.
  - J is greater than A, D, and H.
  - A is greater than D.
  - E is greater than I and D.
  - I is greater than H.

- F is the largest item since it is greater than all other items it is compared with.
- B is the next largest since it is greater than all items except F.
- C follows B as it is greater than most items except F and B.
- J is next as it is greater than A, D, and H.
- A follows J since it is greater than D.
- E is next as it is greater than I and D.
- I follows E since it is greater than H.
- H is next as it is greater than D.
- D is the smallest item.

Therefore, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

F > B > C > J > A > E > I > H > D
