To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I < H
   - H > D
   - D < B
   - B < A
   - A > E
   - E > J
   - J > C
   - C < G
   - G > F

2. From the second list:
   - J < A
   - A > B
   - B > C
   - C < F
   - F < H
   - H < E
   - E > I
   - I < D
   - D > G

3. From the third list:
   - F < H
   - H < A
   - A > C
   - C < J
   - J > I
   - I < E
   - E > D
   - D < B
   - B > G

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- A is consistently greater than B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
- E is greater than D, I, J, C, F, G.
- H is greater than D, F, I, C, G.
- B is greater than D, G, C.
- D is greater than G, I.
- J is greater than C, I.
- G is greater than F.
- F is greater than C.
- C is consistently less than many others.

By combining these, we can deduce the overall order:

A > E > H > B > J > D > G > F > C > I

Therefore, the overall order from the largest to the smallest item is:

A > E > H > B > J > D > G > F > C > I
