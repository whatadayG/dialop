To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B > I
   - I < G
   - G < D
   - D < F
   - F > H
   - H > E
   - E < A
   - A > C
   - C < J

2. From the second list:
   - H > B
   - B < F
   - F > G
   - G < J
   - J > E
   - E < C
   - C < A
   - A > I
   - I < D

3. From the third list:
   - I < F
   - F > E
   - E < A
   - A > G
   - G > B
   - B < C
   - C < D
   - D < J
   - J > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that J is consistently greater than many other items (G, E, D, H), suggesting it is one of the largest.
- A is also consistently greater than many items (E, C, I, G), suggesting it is near the top.
- F is greater than B, G, E, H, and I, placing it high in the order.
- D is greater than G, I, and C, but less than J, placing it below J.
- C is less than A, D, and J, but greater than B.
- H is greater than B and less than J.
- E is less than A, F, J, and H, but greater than B.
- G is less than J, D, and F, but greater than B.
- B is less than F, C, G, and H.
- I is less than B, F, D, and A.

Combining these insights, we can deduce the following order:

J > A > F > D > C > H > G > E > B > I

Therefore, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

J > A > F > D > C > H > G > E > B > I
