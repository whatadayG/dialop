To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B < I
   - I > C
   - C > A
   - A > G
   - G < E
   - E > J
   - J < H
   - H > F
   - F < D

2. From the second list:
   - D > C
   - C < B
   - B < I
   - I > J
   - J > G
   - G < F
   - F < H
   - H < E
   - E > A

3. From the third list:
   - B > C
   - C > A
   - A < J
   - J < E
   - E > H
   - H < D
   - D > F
   - F > G
   - G < I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is consistently greater than B, C, A, G, J, and F.
- E is consistently greater than J, G, H, A, and C.
- D is consistently greater than C, F, and H.
- H is consistently greater than F and G.
- J is consistently greater than G and A.
- B is consistently greater than C.
- C is consistently greater than A.
- F is consistently greater than G.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

I > E > D > H > J > B > C > A > F > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > E > D > H > J > B > C > A > F > G
