To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < H < J > B < D > G < C > I < F < E

2. From the second list:
   - H > B > F > G < C > A < J > D > I < E

3. From the third list:
   - J > A > I < E < D > B > G < C > F < H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- J is consistently greater than A, B, D, and I.
- A is consistently less than J and greater than I.
- H is consistently greater than A, B, F, and G.
- D is consistently greater than B, G, and I.
- C is consistently greater than A, F, and G.
- E is consistently greater than I and F.
- F is consistently less than H and E.
- G is consistently less than C, D, and B.
- I is consistently less than A, D, and E.

From these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

J > H > D > C > A > B > E > F > I > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > H > D > C > A > B > E > F > I > G
