To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships given in the lists and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < G
   - G > C
   - C > D
   - D < E
   - E < B
   - B > J
   - J < I
   - I < H
   - H > F

2. From the second list:
   - F < C
   - C < G
   - G > D
   - D > J
   - J < I
   - I < H
   - H < B
   - B > E
   - E > A

3. From the third list:
   - I < H
   - H > E
   - E > D
   - D < G
   - G > F
   - F < C
   - C < B
   - B > A
   - A < J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can deduce that H is greater than I, J, E, D, F, and A.
- B is greater than H, C, E, D, and A.
- G is greater than C, D, F, and A.
- C is greater than D, F, and A.
- E is greater than D and A.
- D is greater than J and A.
- J is greater than A.
- I is greater than J and A.
- F is greater than A.

By combining these relationships, we can establish the following order:

H > B > G > C > E > D > I > J > F > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > B > G > C > E > D > I > J > F > A
