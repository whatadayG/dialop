To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C > D
   - D > H
   - H < B (implies B > H)
   - B > J
   - J < F (implies F > J)
   - F > E
   - E > A
   - A < G (implies G > A)
   - G > I

2. From the second list:
   - C < F (implies F > C)
   - F > H
   - H < G (implies G > H)
   - G < E (implies E > G)
   - E < B (implies B > E)
   - B > A
   - A < I (implies I > A)
   - I < J (implies J > I)
   - J > D

3. From the third list:
   - J > A
   - A < C (implies C > A)
   - C > I
   - I > D
   - D < F (implies F > D)
   - F > H
   - H < G (implies G > H)
   - G < B (implies B > G)
   - B > E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we see that F is consistently greater than many items: F > C, F > J, F > D, F > H, F > E.
- B is also consistently greater than many items: B > H, B > J, B > E, B > G.
- G is greater than A, H, and I, but less than E and B.
- E is greater than G, A, but less than B and F.
- J is greater than D, I, and A, but less than B and F.
- C is greater than D, I, and A, but less than F.
- I is greater than D and A, but less than C and J.
- D is less than C, F, and J.
- H is less than B, F, and G.
- A is less than C, B, E, G, I, and J.

Considering all these, a consistent order from largest to smallest is:

F > B > E > G > C > J > I > D > H > A

Thus, the overall order is:

F > B > E > G > C > J > I > D > H > A
