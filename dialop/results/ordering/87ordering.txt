To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E > H
   - H < I (which implies I > H)
   - I > G
   - G < B (which implies B > G)
   - B < J (which implies J > B)
   - J > D
   - D < C (which implies C > D)
   - C > F
   - F < A (which implies A > F)

2. From the second list:
   - F < G (which implies G > F)
   - G < J (which implies J > G)
   - J < A (which implies A > J)
   - A < E (which implies E > A)
   - E > D
   - D < C (which implies C > D)
   - C < I (which implies I > C)
   - I > B
   - B > H

3. From the third list:
   - G < J (which implies J > G)
   - J > C
   - C < A (which implies A > C)
   - A < E (which implies E > A)
   - E < I (which implies I > E)
   - I > H
   - H < B (which implies B > H)
   - B > F
   - F < D (which implies D > F)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is consistently greater than many other items (I > H, I > G, I > B, I > C, I > E).
- E is greater than A, D, H, and G, but less than I.
- A is greater than J, C, F, and D, but less than E.
- J is greater than B, G, and D, but less than A.
- B is greater than H, G, and F, but less than J and I.
- C is greater than D and F, but less than A and I.
- G is greater than F, but less than B, J, and I.
- D is greater than F, but less than C, J, and E.
- F is less than A, B, C, D, and G.
- H is less than B, I, and E.

Based on these deductions, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > E > A > J > C > B > G > D > F > H
