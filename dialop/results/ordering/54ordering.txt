To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > E
   - E < I (which means I > E)
   - I > A
   - A < H (which means H > A)
   - H > D
   - D < C (which means C > D)
   - C < G (which means G > C)
   - G < B (which means B > G)
   - B > J

2. From the second list:
   - H > E
   - E < B (which means B > E)
   - B > G
   - G > J
   - J < C (which means C > J)
   - C > D
   - D < A (which means A > D)
   - A < I (which means I > A)
   - I > F

3. From the third list:
   - C > J
   - J < B (which means B > J)
   - B < I (which means I > B)
   - I > E
   - E > A
   - A > D
   - D < G (which means G > D)
   - G < F (which means F > G)
   - F < H (which means H > F)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to determine the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that H is consistently ranked higher than other items (H > F, H > A, H > E).
- I is also ranked very high, as it is greater than F, A, E, and B.
- B is greater than G, J, and E.
- C is greater than J, D, and sometimes G.
- F is greater than G and E.
- G is greater than D and sometimes C.
- E is greater than A and D.
- A is greater than D.
- D is consistently ranked lower than most items.
- J is consistently ranked the lowest.

Based on these observations, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

H > I > B > F > G > C > E > A > D > J
