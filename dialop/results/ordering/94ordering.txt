To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C > J
   - J < G (which means G > J)
   - G > H
   - H < D (which means D > H)
   - D > F
   - F > I
   - I > B
   - B < E (which means E > B)
   - E > A

2. From the second list:
   - I > J
   - J < B (which means B > J)
   - B < E (which means E > B)
   - E > F
   - F < G (which means G > F)
   - G > A
   - A > H
   - H > C
   - C < D (which means D > C)

3. From the third list:
   - G > E
   - E > B
   - B > C
   - C > J
   - J < A (which means A > J)
   - A < F (which means F > A)
   - F < D (which means D > F)
   - D > H
   - H < I (which means I > H)

Now, let's try to construct the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that D is consistently greater than many other items (D > H, D > F, D > C).
- G is also consistently greater than many items (G > H, G > F, G > A, G > E).
- E is greater than B and A.
- I is greater than J, H, and B.
- F is greater than A and J.
- A is greater than J.
- B is greater than C and J.
- C is greater than J.

Considering all these, we can try to construct the order starting from the largest:

1. D (since D > G, D > F, D > C, D > H)
2. G (since G > E, G > F, G > A, G > H)
3. E (since E > B, E > F, E > A)
4. I (since I > H, I > J, I > B)
5. F (since F > A, F > J)
6. A (since A > J)
7. B (since B > C, B > J)
8. C (since C > J)
9. J

Thus, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

D > G > E > I > F > A > B > C > J
