To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > J > G > C < A < B < D > I < H > E

2. From the second list:
   - C < G < H > J > D > B < F > A > I < E

3. From the third list:
   - F > I < C < G < E < B > A < J < H > D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- F is greater than J, G, C, A, and I, and also greater than B from the second list.
- J is greater than G, C, D, and A.
- G is greater than C and E.
- C is less than G and greater than I.
- A is less than B and greater than I.
- B is less than D and greater than A.
- D is greater than I and B.
- I is less than C, A, and E.
- H is greater than J, D, and E.
- E is less than B and greater than I.

By combining these relationships, we can deduce the overall order:

F > H > J > G > D > B > A > C > E > I

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

F > H > J > G > D > B > A > C > E > I
