To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and find a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G > F
   - F < H (implies H > F)
   - H > A
   - A < D (implies D > A)
   - D > I
   - I > E
   - E < C (implies C > E)
   - C < J (implies J > C)
   - J > B

2. From the second list:
   - J > G
   - G < H (implies H > G)
   - H > I
   - I < A (implies A > I)
   - A > C
   - C > E
   - E < D (implies D > E)
   - D > B
   - B > F

3. From the third list:
   - F < J (implies J > F)
   - J > A
   - A < D (implies D > A)
   - D < H (implies H > D)
   - H > G
   - G > E
   - E < C (implies C > E)
   - C < B (implies B > C)
   - B > I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we see that J is consistently greater than many items: J > G, J > C, J > B, J > A, J > F.
- H is also consistently greater than many items: H > F, H > G, H > A, H > I, H > D.
- D is greater than A, I, E, and B.
- A is greater than I and C.
- C is greater than E.
- B is greater than F and C.
- G is greater than F and E.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

J > H > D > A > G > B > C > I > E > F

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > H > D > A > G > B > C > I > E > F
