To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B < E
   - E < D
   - D < A
   - A > G
   - G < I
   - I > H
   - H < J
   - J < F
   - F > C

2. From the second list:
   - H < F
   - F > B
   - B < E
   - E > J
   - J < D
   - D > C
   - C < A
   - A > I
   - I > G

3. From the third list:
   - I > B
   - B > G
   - G > C
   - C < D
   - D < F
   - F < A
   - A > J
   - J > H
   - H < E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we have: A > D > E > B, A > F > J > H, I > G > C.
- From the second list, we have: A > I > G, F > H, E > J > D > C.
- From the third list, we have: A > F > D > C, I > B > G, J > H < E.

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

A > F > D > E > J > I > B > H > G > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

A > F > D > E > J > I > B > H > G > C
