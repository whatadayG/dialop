To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F < J
   - J > C
   - C < A
   - A > G
   - G < E
   - E > H
   - H < B
   - B > I
   - I < D

2. From the second list:
   - E > A
   - A < H
   - H > F
   - F > D
   - D > C
   - C < J
   - J < B
   - B > I
   - I > G

3. From the third list:
   - E > F
   - F > C
   - C < I
   - I < J
   - J > G
   - G < D
   - D < H
   - H > A
   - A < B

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that E is consistently greater than many other items (A, F, etc.), suggesting E is one of the largest.
- B is also consistently greater than many items (H, J, A, etc.).
- J is greater than several items but less than B.
- H is greater than A, F, and D, but less than B.
- A is greater than G and C, but less than H and B.
- F is greater than D and C, but less than E and H.
- D is greater than C and I, but less than F and H.
- C is less than many items, suggesting it is one of the smallest.
- I is less than D and J, but greater than G.
- G is consistently less than many items, suggesting it is one of the smallest.

Based on these deductions, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

E > B > J > H > A > F > D > I > C > G
