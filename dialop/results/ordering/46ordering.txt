To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists and deduce the relative ranking of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C < H < A > D < F > G < B > J < E > I

2. From the second list:
   - E > I > C < G < A > H > D < B > F > J

3. From the third list:
   - B > G > D < A < E > F > C < J < I > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the item that appears to be the largest in multiple lists: E.
- E is greater than I, F, A, and C in various comparisons.
- I is greater than C, J, and H.
- B is greater than G, D, F, and J.
- A is greater than D, H, and G.
- F is greater than G, C, and J.
- G is greater than D and C.
- J is greater than C.
- H is greater than D.
- D is greater than none.

By combining these insights, we can deduce the overall order:

E > I > B > A > F > G > H > J > C > D

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > I > B > A > F > G > H > J > C > D
