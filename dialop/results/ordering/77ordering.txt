To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking of the items.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > D > J < I > C < G < H < F > B < E

2. From the second list:
   - A < H > C < I > J < E > D > B < F > G

3. From the third list:
   - F > E < G > J < D < I > B < H > A > C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we see that A is greater than D, J, C, G, H, F, and B, but less than E.
- From the second list, A is less than H, which is greater than C, I, J, E, D, B, F, and G.
- From the third list, A is greater than C, but less than H.

Combining these insights, we can deduce the following order:

H > I > A > F > E > G > D > J > C > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > I > A > F > E > G > D > J > C > B
