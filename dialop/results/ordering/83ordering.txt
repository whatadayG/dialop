To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I > H
   - H < C (which means C > H)
   - C > G
   - G < B (which means B > G)
   - B > F
   - F < D (which means D > F)
   - D > A
   - A > E
   - E > J

2. From the second list:
   - I > J
   - J > G
   - G < C (which means C > G)
   - C > H
   - H < B (which means B > H)
   - B > F
   - F < E (which means E > F)
   - E < D (which means D > E)
   - D > A

3. From the third list:
   - E > B
   - B > F
   - F < C (which means C > F)
   - C > D
   - D > H
   - H < J (which means J > H)
   - J < A (which means A > J)
   - A < I (which means I > A)
   - I > G

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons to find the overall order:

- I consistently appears as the largest item in all lists.
- C is consistently larger than many other items, but smaller than I.
- D is larger than many items but smaller than C.
- B is larger than several items but smaller than D.
- E is larger than several items but smaller than B.
- A is larger than several items but smaller than E.
- J is larger than several items but smaller than A.
- H is larger than several items but smaller than J.
- F is larger than several items but smaller than H.
- G is consistently smaller than many items.

Based on these observations, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > C > D > B > E > A > J > H > F > G
