To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list: 
   - G > D > H < A < C > I < B < E > J < F

2. From the second list:
   - D > F > I < H < G > B < J < A < C > E

3. From the third list:
   - F < C < D > E > H > I < G > B < A > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the most frequently appearing relationships:
  - G is consistently greater than D, H, I, B, and F.
  - D is consistently greater than F, E, H, and I.
  - C is consistently greater than E, F, and I.
  - A is consistently greater than J and less than C.
  - E is consistently greater than J and less than D.
  - B is consistently less than G and greater than J.
  - H is consistently greater than I and less than D.
  - J is consistently less than E and A.

- From these observations, we can deduce the following order:
  - G > D > C > A > E > H > F > I > B > J

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:
G > D > C > A > E > H > F > I > B > J
