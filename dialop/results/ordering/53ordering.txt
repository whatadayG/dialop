To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent order that satisfies all the given comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F < J < E > I < A < G > C < D > B < H

2. From the second list:
   - F > I < G > E > C > H < D > A > J < B

3. From the third list:
   - F < H > J > I < D > C < A > B < G > E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have: G > A > I > F, G > C, D > C, D > B, H > B
- From the second list, we have: G > I, G > E, E > C, D > A, A > J, B > J
- From the third list, we have: H > J, J > I, D > C, A > B, G > E

By combining these relationships, we can deduce the following order:

G > H > D > A > E > J > I > F > C > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > H > D > A > E > J > I > F > C > B
