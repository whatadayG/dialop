To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > D > G > H > B < E < A > C < I < J

2. From the second list:
   - F > C > H > B < A > E > G < I > D < J

3. From the third list:
   - D < E < J > G > B < C > H < F < I > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- F is consistently greater than D, C, H, and B.
- A is consistently greater than E, B, and C.
- J is consistently greater than I, D, and G.
- I is consistently greater than F, D, and C.
- E is consistently greater than D and B.
- C is consistently greater than H and B.
- G is consistently greater than B.

From these observations, we can deduce the following order:

J > I > F > A > E > C > G > H > D > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > I > F > A > E > C > G > H > D > B
