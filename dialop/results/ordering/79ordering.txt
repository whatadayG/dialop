To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < J < G > D > I < A > C < B < F > H

2. From the second list:
   - G > J > E < D < B > I > C < F > A > H

3. From the third list:
   - E < G > J < D > H > C < B > I < F > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- G is consistently greater than J, E, and D.
- J is consistently greater than E.
- D is greater than H and I.
- B is greater than I and C.
- F is greater than A, C, and I.
- A is greater than H and C.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

G > J > D > B > F > A > E > I > H > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > J > D > B > F > A > E > I > H > C
