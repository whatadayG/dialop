To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I > C > G < D > B < F > H > E < A < J

2. From the second list:
   - F > J > E < H < D > G < B > A < C < I

3. From the third list:
   - D < I > C > G < A < H > B > E < F > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have I > C, C > G, G < D, D > B, B < F, F > H, H > E, E < A, A < J.
- From the second list, we have F > J, J > E, E < H, H < D, D > G, G < B, B > A, A < C, C < I.
- From the third list, we have D < I, I > C, C > G, G < A, A < H, H > B, B > E, E < F, F > J.

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. I is consistently greater than C, D, G, A, H, B, E, F, and J.
2. C is consistently greater than G, A, H, B, E, F, and J.
3. D is consistently greater than G, A, H, B, E, F, and J.
4. F is consistently greater than J, E, H, B, and A.
5. H is consistently greater than B, E, and A.
6. B is consistently greater than E and A.
7. E is consistently greater than A.

Thus, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > C > D > F > H > B > E > A > J > G
