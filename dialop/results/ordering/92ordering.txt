To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G > C
   - C < H (which means H > C)
   - H < F (which means F > H)
   - F > D
   - D < E (which means E > D)
   - E > J
   - J > A
   - A > B
   - B < I (which means I > B)

2. From the second list:
   - C < F (which means F > C)
   - F > B
   - B < J (which means J > B)
   - J < I (which means I > J)
   - I > A
   - A < G (which means G > A)
   - G > D
   - D < E (which means E > D)
   - E > H

3. From the third list:
   - I > A
   - A > D
   - D < F (which means F > D)
   - F > E
   - E > C
   - C > B
   - B < G (which means G > B)
   - G < J (which means J > G)
   - J > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is consistently ranked higher than many other items, including A, J, and B.
- J is ranked higher than G, H, and B.
- G is ranked higher than A, D, C, and B.
- F is ranked higher than E, D, H, C, and B.
- E is ranked higher than D, H, C, and B.
- H is ranked higher than C and B.
- C is ranked higher than B.
- A is ranked higher than D and B.
- D is ranked higher than B.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

I > J > G > F > E > H > C > A > D > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > J > G > F > E > H > C > A > D > B
