To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

From the first list:
- E > J
- J < B (implies B > J)
- B < C (implies C > B)
- C < F (implies F > C)
- F > G
- G < H (implies H > G)
- H > A
- A > I
- I > D

From the second list:
- J < E (implies E > J)
- E > A
- A > I
- I < F (implies F > I)
- F > B
- B > G
- G < H (implies H > G)
- H < C (implies C > H)
- C > D

From the third list:
- C > B
- B > G
- G < E (implies E > G)
- E > D
- D < I (implies I > D)
- I < F (implies F > I)
- F > J
- J < H (implies H > J)
- H > A

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons to find the overall order:

1. F is greater than C, B, J, G, I, D, and A.
2. E is greater than J, G, D, and A.
3. C is greater than B, G, H, and D.
4. H is greater than G, J, and A.
5. B is greater than J and G.
6. A is greater than I.
7. I is greater than D.

From these deductions, we can establish the following order:

F > E > C > H > B > A > I > J > G > D

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

F > E > C > H > B > A > I > J > G > D
