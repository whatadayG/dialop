To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B < A < C > D < J < G > E < F > H < I

2. From the second list:
   - J > D < C > E > B < G > I > F > H < A

3. From the third list:
   - B < G > I < C > F > D < J > H < E > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have: B < A < C > D < J < G > E < F > H < I
- From the second list, we have: J > D < C > E > B < G > I > F > H < A
- From the third list, we have: B < G > I < C > F > D < J > H < E > A

By analyzing these, we can deduce the following order:

G > J > C > E > A > I > F > D > H > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > J > C > E > A > I > F > D > H > B
