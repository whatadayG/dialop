To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < F
   - F > J
   - J < E
   - E > I
   - I > H
   - H > D
   - D < B
   - B > G
   - G > C

2. From the second list:
   - A < C
   - C < F
   - F < B
   - B > I
   - I < E
   - E > H
   - H < G
   - G > J
   - J > D

3. From the third list:
   - F > D
   - D < C
   - C < E
   - E > A
   - A < H
   - H < I
   - I < B
   - B > G
   - G > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we can deduce: F > J > D, E > I > H > D, B > G > C, and A < F.
- From the second list, we can deduce: C < F < B, E > H < G, and A < C.
- From the third list, we can deduce: F > D < C < E, E > A < H < I < B, and G > J.

Combining all these deductions, we can establish the following order:

B > E > F > I > G > H > J > C > A > D

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

B > E > F > I > G > H > J > C > A > D
