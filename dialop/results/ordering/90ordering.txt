To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists and consolidate the information to find a consistent ranking of all items.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < I
   - I > F
   - F < G
   - G > J
   - J > C
   - C > H
   - H > E
   - E < B
   - B > D

2. From the second list:
   - E < H
   - H < J
   - J < G
   - G > C
   - C < I
   - I > F
   - F < A
   - A > D
   - D < B

3. From the third list:
   - B > A
   - A > F
   - F < G
   - G > E
   - E < C
   - C > D
   - D > H
   - H < I
   - I > J

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons:

- From the first list, we can deduce: B > E > H > C > J > G > F > I > A > D
- From the second list, we can deduce: B > D > A > F > I > C > G > J > H > E
- From the third list, we can deduce: B > A > F > G > E > C > D > H > I > J

Combining these deductions, we can find a consistent order:

1. B is consistently the largest.
2. G is consistently larger than J, E, and F.
3. A is consistently larger than F and D.
4. I is consistently larger than J.
5. C is consistently larger than D and H.
6. J is consistently smaller than G and I.
7. E is consistently smaller than G and larger than H.
8. H is consistently smaller than C and larger than D.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

B > G > I > A > F > C > J > E > H > D

Therefore, the final order is:

B > G > I > A > F > C > J > E > H > D
