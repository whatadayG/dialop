To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - D < H
   - H > I
   - I < A
   - A > J
   - J < B
   - B > F
   - F < E
   - E < C
   - C > G

2. From the second list:
   - G < I
   - I > E
   - E < J
   - J > F
   - F < C
   - C > H
   - H < A
   - A > D
   - D < B

3. From the third list:
   - E < C
   - C > I
   - I > G
   - G > D
   - D < J
   - J > F
   - F < H
   - H < B
   - B > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we can deduce: C > E > F > B > J > A > I > H > D > G
- From the second list, we can deduce: A > B > D > H > C > F > J > E > I > G
- From the third list, we can deduce: C > E > J > D > G > I > H > F > B > A

By combining these deductions, we can find the overall order:

C > E > J > B > A > I > H > F > D > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

C > E > J > B > A > I > H > F > D > G
