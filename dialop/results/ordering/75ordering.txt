To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking of the items.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - H > J
   - J < G (which means G > J)
   - G < A (which means A > G)
   - A > D
   - D > C
   - C < E (which means E > C)
   - E > B
   - B < I (which means I > B)
   - I > F

2. From the second list:
   - G < I (which means I > G)
   - I > F
   - F < H (which means H > F)
   - H > A
   - A > D
   - D > B
   - B < E (which means E > B)
   - E > J
   - J > C

3. From the third list:
   - D < H (which means H > D)
   - H > J
   - J > B
   - B < G (which means G > B)
   - G > C
   - C < A (which means A > C)
   - A > E
   - E > F
   - F < I (which means I > F)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that H is consistently greater than many items: H > J, H > A, H > F, H > D.
- I is also consistently greater than many items: I > F, I > G, I > B.
- A is greater than G, D, C, E.
- E is greater than B, C, F, J.
- G is greater than J, B, C.
- D is greater than C, B.
- J is greater than B, C.
- B is greater than none of the items it is compared with.

By synthesizing these comparisons, we can deduce the following order:

H > I > A > G > E > J > D > C > B > F

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > I > A > G > E > J > D > C > B > F
