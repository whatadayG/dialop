To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > G > D > I < E < A < H > B < J > C

2. From the second list:
   - D > B > I < G > E < J < A < H > C < F

3. From the third list:
   - E > I > C < A > D < G > B < H > F < J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the most frequently appearing relationships:
  - F appears to be greater than G and H.
  - G is greater than D, E, and B.
  - D is greater than I and B.
  - E is greater than I.
  - A is greater than D, E, and C.
  - H is greater than B, C, and F.
  - J is greater than F, C, and B.

- From these, we can deduce:
  - A is the largest since it is greater than D, E, and C, and no item is consistently shown to be greater than A.
  - J is greater than F, C, and B, and no item is consistently shown to be greater than J except A.
  - H is greater than B, C, and F, and no item is consistently shown to be greater than H except A and J.
  - F is greater than G and H, but less than J and A.
  - G is greater than D, E, and B, but less than F and A.
  - D is greater than I and B, but less than G and A.
  - E is greater than I, but less than G, J, and A.
  - I is less than D and E.
  - C is less than A, J, and H.
  - B is less than D, G, H, and J.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

A > J > H > F > G > D > E > I > C > B
