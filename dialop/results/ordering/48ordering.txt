To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I > H > D < B > A < E > F < C > G < J

2. From the second list:
   - D > G < I < B > E < J > C < A > H > F

3. From the third list:
   - C < E > F > G < I < B > A > D < J > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the most frequently mentioned relationships:
  - I is greater than H, G, and D.
  - B is greater than D, A, E, and I.
  - E is greater than A, F, C, and D.
  - J is greater than C, G, D, and H.

- From these, we can deduce:
  - B is the largest since it is greater than many other items.
  - I is greater than H, G, and D, but less than B.
  - J is greater than C, G, D, and H, but less than B.
  - E is greater than A, F, C, and D, but less than B and J.

- Combining these deductions, we get the following order:
  - B > J > E > I > A > H > F > C > D > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

B > J > E > I > A > H > F > C > D > G
