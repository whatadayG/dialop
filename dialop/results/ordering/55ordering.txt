To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - H > E > G > J < I > C < B < F < A < D

2. From the second list:
   - I > C < H > J < G > B < F < A > E < D

3. From the third list:
   - C < D > I < F > E > B > J < H > G < A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have D as the largest item.
- From the second list, D is also larger than E, which is consistent with the first list.
- From the third list, D is larger than C, which is consistent with the first list.

Let's start with D as the largest and build the order:

1. D is larger than A, E, I, and C.
2. A is larger than F, which is larger than I (from the third list).
3. I is larger than C (from all lists).
4. C is larger than H (from the second list).
5. H is larger than G (from the third list).
6. G is larger than B (from the second list).
7. B is larger than J (from the third list).

Combining all these, we get the order:

D > A > F > I > C > H > G > B > J > E

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

D > A > F > I > C > H > G > B > J > E
