To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships between the items and establish a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > F
   - F < E (implies E > F)
   - E > B
   - B < G (implies G > B)
   - G > C
   - C > H
   - H < J (implies J > H)
   - J > I
   - I < D (implies D > I)

2. From the second list:
   - I < A (implies A > I)
   - A < G (implies G > A)
   - G < E (implies E > G)
   - E > J
   - J > F
   - F < H (implies H > F)
   - H < D (implies D > H)
   - D > B
   - B > C

3. From the third list:
   - E > I
   - I > F
   - F < D (implies D > F)
   - D > A
   - A < J (implies J > A)
   - J > B
   - B > H
   - H < G (implies G > H)
   - G > C

Now, let's combine these comparisons to establish a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that E is consistently greater than many other items (E > F, E > B, E > J, E > G, E > I).
- D is also consistently greater than many items (D > I, D > H, D > B, D > F, D > A).
- G is greater than A, B, C, and H.
- J is greater than A, B, F, H, and I.
- A is greater than F and I.
- B is greater than C and H.
- C is greater than H.
- H is greater than F.
- I is greater than F.

Based on these relationships, we can establish the following order:

E > D > G > J > A > B > C > H > I > F

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > D > G > J > A > B > C > H > I > F
