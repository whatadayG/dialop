To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all of them.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C < D
   - D > G
   - G > E
   - E < B
   - B > I
   - I < A
   - A > J
   - J > F
   - F < H

2. From the second list:
   - F < D
   - D > J
   - J > G
   - G < B
   - B > I
   - I < C
   - C > E
   - E < A
   - A < H

3. From the third list:
   - B < A
   - A < H
   - H > C
   - C > F
   - F < J
   - J > I
   - I > E
   - E < D
   - D > G

Now, let's try to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we see that H is consistently greater than A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, and J. So, H is the largest.
- A is greater than B, C, D, E, F, G, I, and J, but less than H.
- B is greater than C, D, E, F, G, I, and J, but less than A and H.
- C is greater than D, E, F, G, I, and J, but less than A, B, and H.
- D is greater than E, F, G, I, and J, but less than A, B, C, and H.
- E is greater than F, G, I, and J, but less than A, B, C, D, and H.
- F is greater than G, I, and J, but less than A, B, C, D, E, and H.
- G is greater than I and J, but less than A, B, C, D, E, F, and H.
- I is greater than J, but less than A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.
- J is the smallest.

Therefore, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

H > A > B > C > D > E > F > G > I > J
