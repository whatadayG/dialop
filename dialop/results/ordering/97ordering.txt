To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of inequalities and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G < J
   - J < A
   - A > C
   - C > D
   - D > B
   - B > H
   - H < E
   - E < F
   - F > I

2. From the second list:
   - C > J
   - J < A
   - A < F
   - F > B
   - B < D
   - D > H
   - H < I
   - I > G
   - G > E

3. From the third list:
   - I < F
   - F > C
   - C > J
   - J > H
   - H < G
   - G > B
   - B > E
   - E < A
   - A > D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that F is consistently greater than many other items (A, C, I, B, etc.), suggesting F is one of the largest items.
- A is consistently greater than C, D, and E, but less than F.
- C is greater than J and D, but less than A and F.
- D is greater than B and H, but less than C and A.
- B is greater than E and H, but less than D and F.
- H is less than J, D, B, and G, but greater than E.
- E is less than A, B, and H.
- J is less than A and C, but greater than G and H.
- G is less than J and I, but greater than E.
- I is less than F, but greater than G and H.

By synthesizing these observations, we can deduce the following order:

F > A > C > J > D > I > G > B > H > E

Therefore, the overall order from the largest to the smallest item is:

F > A > C > J > D > I > G > B > H > E
