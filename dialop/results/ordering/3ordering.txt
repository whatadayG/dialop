To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships between the items and establish a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

From the first list:
- C > B
- B < J (implies J > B)
- J < F (implies F > J)
- F > E
- E > D
- D > I
- I < A (implies A > I)
- A < G (implies G > A)
- G > H

From the second list:
- H < D (implies D > H)
- D < G (implies G > D)
- G > C
- C > E
- E < F (implies F > E)
- F > J
- J > A
- A > I
- I < B (implies B > I)

From the third list:
- D > I
- I < J (implies J > I)
- J > H
- H < B (implies B > H)
- B < G (implies G > B)
- G > F
- F > C
- C > E
- E > A

Now, let's combine these relationships to determine the overall order:

1. G is consistently shown to be greater than F, D, C, B, A, and H.
2. F is greater than J, E, C, and A.
3. D is greater than I and H.
4. C is greater than B, E, and A.
5. J is greater than B, H, and I.
6. B is greater than I and H.
7. E is greater than A.
8. A is greater than I.
9. H is consistently shown to be less than D, B, J, and G.

Based on these relationships, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

G > F > D > C > J > B > E > A > I > H
