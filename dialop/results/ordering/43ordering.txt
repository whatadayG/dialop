To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C < A
   - A > H
   - H < G
   - G < E
   - E < B
   - B < F
   - F > J
   - J > D
   - D > I

2. From the second list:
   - C > D
   - D < E
   - E > I
   - I < G
   - G < B
   - B < A
   - A > F
   - F > H
   - H < J

3. From the third list:
   - G < F
   - F < A
   - A > I
   - I < J
   - J < E
   - E > D
   - D < H
   - H < C
   - C < B

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have a chain: C < A > H < G < E < B < F > J > D > I.
- From the second list, we have: C > D < E > I < G < B < A > F > H < J.
- From the third list, we have: G < F < A > I < J < E > D < H < C < B.

By combining these chains and resolving conflicts, we can derive the overall order:

1. A is consistently greater than most other items.
2. F is greater than G, H, J, D, and I.
3. B is greater than C, G, and E.
4. E is greater than D and I.
5. J is greater than D and I.
6. C is less than B, A, and F but greater than D and H.

Considering all these relationships, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

A > F > B > E > J > G > C > H > D > I
