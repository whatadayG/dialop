To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G > H
   - H < D (which means D > H)
   - D < A (which means A > D)
   - A < J (which means J > A)
   - J > F
   - F < I (which means I > F)
   - I > E
   - E < C (which means C > E)
   - C < B (which means B > C)

2. From the second list:
   - F > D
   - D < G (which means G > D)
   - G > I
   - I > A
   - A > C
   - C > E
   - E < B (which means B > E)
   - B > J
   - J > H

3. From the third list:
   - I > A
   - A < B (which means B > A)
   - B > D
   - D < G (which means G > D)
   - G > H
   - H < C (which means C > H)
   - C > E
   - E < J (which means J > E)
   - J > F

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is greater than H, D, and I.
- B is greater than C, A, D, E, and J.
- J is greater than A, F, and E.
- I is greater than A, F, and E.
- A is greater than D and C.
- C is greater than E and H.
- F is greater than D.
- D is greater than H.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

G > I > B > J > A > C > F > D > H > E

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > I > B > J > A > C > F > D > H > E
