To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative ranking of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C > B
   - B < J (which implies J > B)
   - J > H
   - H < D (which implies D > H)
   - D > A
   - A < G (which implies G > A)
   - G < F (which implies F > G)
   - F > I
   - I < E (which implies E > I)

2. From the second list:
   - D < J (which implies J > D)
   - J > H
   - H < C (which implies C > H)
   - C > I
   - I < E (which implies E > I)
   - E > G
   - G > A
   - A < F (which implies F > A)
   - F > B

3. From the third list:
   - J > D
   - D > I
   - I > A
   - A < F (which implies F > A)
   - F > E
   - E < C (which implies C > E)
   - C > G
   - G < B (which implies B > G)
   - B > H

Now, let's combine these comparisons to determine the overall order:

- J is consistently shown to be greater than D, H, and B.
- C is greater than B, H, I, and E.
- F is greater than E, A, G, and B.
- E is greater than G and I.
- D is greater than H, A, and I.
- B is greater than G and H.
- G is greater than A.
- I is greater than A.
- H is not greater than any item except possibly A.

By combining these insights, we can deduce the overall order:

J > C > F > D > E > B > G > I > H > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > C > F > D > E > B > G > I > H > A
