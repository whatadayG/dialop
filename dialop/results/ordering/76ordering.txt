To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < A
   - A > H
   - H < F
   - F < D
   - D > B
   - B > G
   - G > I
   - I > C
   - C < J

2. From the second list:
   - J < D
   - D > B
   - B > F
   - F > E
   - E > C
   - C < H
   - H < G
   - G > I
   - I < A

3. From the third list:
   - C < E
   - E < H
   - H < B
   - B > I
   - I < A
   - A > J
   - J < G
   - G > F
   - F < D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that D is consistently greater than many other items (B, F, J, etc.).
- A is greater than E, H, I, and J.
- G is greater than F, I, J, and C.
- B is greater than F, I, G, and C.
- F is greater than E and C.
- E is greater than C.
- H is greater than C.
- J is greater than C.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

D > A > B > G > F > H > E > J > I > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

D > A > B > G > F > H > E > J > I > C
