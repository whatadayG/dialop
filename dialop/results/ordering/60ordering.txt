To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F < E < D > J < I > C < H > A < G < B

2. From the second list:
   - D > C < E > J < F < H > I > A < G < B

3. From the third list:
   - I > C < G < F > J < E < H > A < B > D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the item that appears to be the largest in most comparisons. B is consistently larger than many other items.
- Next, G is consistently larger than A and smaller than B.
- H is larger than A, G, and F, but smaller than B.
- E is larger than J and smaller than H.
- F is smaller than E and H but larger than J.
- D is larger than J, C, and A but smaller than B.
- I is larger than C and A but smaller than H.
- C is smaller than I, D, and E.
- J is smaller than D, F, and E.
- A is consistently the smallest.

Putting it all together, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

B > G > H > E > F > D > I > C > J > A
