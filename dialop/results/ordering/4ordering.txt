To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - H < E < F > I < A > C > J < B > G < D

2. From the second list:
   - E > H < I < A > C < D > J < F > G < B

3. From the third list:
   - I < C < D > F > J < H < A > B > G < E

Now, let's combine these relationships to find a consistent order:

- From all lists, A is consistently greater than other items, suggesting A is the largest.
- D is consistently greater than most items except A, suggesting D is the second largest.
- C is consistently greater than many items but less than A and D, suggesting C is next.
- F is greater than many items but less than A, D, and C.
- B is greater than several items but less than A, D, C, and F.
- E is greater than some items but less than A, D, C, F, and B.
- I is less than many items but greater than H and J.
- G is less than many items but greater than H and J.
- H is less than many items but greater than J.
- J is consistently less than most items.

Combining these insights, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

A > D > C > F > B > E > I > G > H > J
