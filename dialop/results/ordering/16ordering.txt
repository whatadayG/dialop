To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G > J
   - J < D (which implies D > J)
   - D < B (which implies B > D)
   - B < A (which implies A > B)
   - A < F (which implies F > A)
   - F > H
   - H < C (which implies C > H)
   - C < E (which implies E > C)
   - E > I

2. From the second list:
   - J < I (which implies I > J)
   - I < A (which implies A > I)
   - A > H
   - H < B (which implies B > H)
   - B < E (which implies E > B)
   - E > G
   - G < C (which implies C > G)
   - C > D
   - D < F (which implies F > D)

3. From the third list:
   - D < F (which implies F > D)
   - F > A
   - A > C
   - C < E (which implies E > C)
   - E > B
   - B > H
   - H < I (which implies I > H)
   - I < G (which implies G > I)
   - G > J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that F is consistently greater than many other items (A, D, H, etc.).
- E is also consistently greater than many items (C, B, G, etc.).
- G is greater than J and I, but less than C and E.
- A is greater than B, C, and I, but less than F.
- B is greater than D and H, but less than A and E.
- C is greater than D, G, and H, but less than A and E.
- D is less than many items (B, C, F, etc.).
- H is less than many items (A, B, C, etc.).
- I is greater than J and H, but less than A and G.
- J is less than many items (D, G, I, etc.).

Considering all these relationships, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

F > E > A > C > G > I > B > D > H > J
