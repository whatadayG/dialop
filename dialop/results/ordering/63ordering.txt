To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > F > C < D < G < I > B < H > J < E

2. From the second list:
   - C < F < J < A < E > I < H > B > G > D

3. From the third list:
   - H > B < E > A > D < G < J > C < I > F

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have A > F and A < E, so E > A > F.
- From the second list, we have E > I and I < H, so E > H > I.
- From the third list, we have E > A and A > D, so E > A > D.
- Combining these, we have E > A > F > C and E > H > I.
- From the second list, we have H > B and B > G, so H > B > G.
- From the third list, we have H > B and B < E, so E > H > B.
- From the first list, we have G < I and I > B, so I > G > D.
- From the third list, we have G < J and J > C, so J > G > D.

Combining all these deductions, we can form the overall order:

E > A > H > J > I > F > B > G > D > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > A > H > J > I > F > B > G > D > C
