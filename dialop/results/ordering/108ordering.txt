To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F > A > B > D < J < E > H > C < I > G

2. From the second list:
   - A > B < C < J < F > D < H > I > G < E

3. From the third list:
   - B < J > G < F > A > D > C < H < E > I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- F is consistently greater than A, B, D, G, and J.
- E is consistently greater than J, H, C, I, and G.
- J is consistently greater than B, D, G, and C.
- A is consistently greater than B, D, and C.
- H is consistently greater than C and I.
- I is consistently greater than G.

From these observations, we can deduce the following order:

F > E > J > A > H > B > D > C > I > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

F > E > J > A > H > B > D > C > I > G
