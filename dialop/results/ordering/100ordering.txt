To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E > H
   - H < I (which means I > H)
   - I < G (which means G > I)
   - G > A
   - A > B
   - B < C (which means C > B)
   - C < D (which means D > C)
   - D > F
   - F < J (which means J > F)

2. From the second list:
   - I < C (which means C > I)
   - C > A
   - A < D (which means D > A)
   - D > B
   - B < F (which means F > B)
   - F > H
   - H < J (which means J > H)
   - J > G
   - G > E

3. From the third list:
   - D > C
   - C > E
   - E < G (which means G > E)
   - G > H
   - H < B (which means B > H)
   - B < J (which means J > B)
   - J > A
   - A < F (which means F > A)
   - F > I

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that J is greater than many items: J > G, J > F, J > H, J > B, J > A.
- G is also greater than many items: G > I, G > E, G > H, G > A.
- D is greater than C, A, B, and F.
- C is greater than E, I, A, and B.
- F is greater than A, B, H, and I.
- A is greater than B.
- B is greater than H.
- E is greater than H.

By analyzing these relationships, we can deduce the following order:

J > G > D > C > F > A > B > I > E > H

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > G > D > C > F > A > B > I > E > H
