To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and establish a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < G < H < J > B > C < E < F > D > I

2. From the second list:
   - I < E > A < H < J > B > C < D < F > G

3. From the third list:
   - C < F > B > A < H > G < E < D > I < J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- Start with the largest item, which appears to be J, as it is greater than H, B, and I in multiple comparisons.
- Next, H is consistently shown to be greater than A and G, and less than J.
- F is greater than B, C, D, and G, but less than E.
- E is greater than A, C, D, and I, but less than F.
- B is greater than A and C, but less than J and F.
- C is less than B, F, and E, but greater than D.
- D is less than F and E, but greater than I.
- I is consistently shown to be the smallest item.

Combining these insights, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

J > H > F > E > G > B > A > C > D > I
