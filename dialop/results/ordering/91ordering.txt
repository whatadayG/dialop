To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships between the items and establish a consistent ranking.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - E < G
   - G > I
   - I > D
   - D > B
   - B < H
   - H < A
   - A > F
   - F > J
   - J < C

2. From the second list:
   - D < A
   - A > E
   - E < H
   - H > B
   - B < F
   - F > J
   - J < I
   - I > C
   - C < G

3. From the third list:
   - J < A
   - A > D
   - D < E
   - E < G
   - G > C
   - C > B
   - B < H
   - H > F
   - F < I

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is consistently greater than E, I, C, and others, suggesting G is one of the largest.
- A is consistently greater than many items, including D, E, F, J, and others, suggesting A is also among the largest.
- I is greater than D, C, F, and J, placing it relatively high.
- H is greater than B, F, and E, placing it in the middle.
- F is greater than J and B, but less than A, H, and I.
- J is consistently less than many items, placing it near the bottom.
- C is greater than J and B, but less than G and I.
- E is less than G, A, and H, but greater than D.
- D is less than A, I, and E, but greater than B.
- B is consistently less than many items, placing it near the bottom.

By synthesizing these observations, we can establish the following order:

G > A > I > H > E > D > C > F > B > J

Therefore, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

G > A > I > H > E > D > C > F > B > J
