To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - F < A < G < H > I > B < E > J < D > C

2. From the second list:
   - F < J > B < E < H > C < G > I < D > A

3. From the third list:
   - C < H < D > A > F < B < I < J < E > G

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have a partial order: F < A < G < H > I > B < E > J < D > C
- From the second list, we can see that J > B and E < H, which is consistent with the first list.
- From the third list, we have C < H < D > A, which is consistent with the first list.

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

H > D > A > G > I > E > J > B > F > C

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

H > D > A > G > I > E > J > B > F > C
