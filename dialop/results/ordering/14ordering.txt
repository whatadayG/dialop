To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I < H < D > J < F < E > B < A > C > G

2. From the second list:
   - J < B > G < F < E > C > I < D > H < A

3. From the third list:
   - C > G < I > J < A < E > B < H > F < D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have: D > J, E > B, A > C, C > G
- From the second list, we have: B > G, E > C, D > H
- From the third list, we have: I > J, E > B, H > F

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. E is greater than B, C, and F.
2. D is greater than J, H, and F.
3. A is greater than C and H.
4. C is greater than G and I.
5. B is greater than G.
6. I is greater than J.

Combining all these, we get the overall order:

E > A > D > H > F > B > C > I > J > G

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

E > A > D > H > F > B > C > I > J > G
