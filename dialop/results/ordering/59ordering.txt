To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given lists of comparisons and deduce a consistent order that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I > D
   - D < A (which means A > D)
   - A < G (which means G > A)
   - G > F
   - F < J (which means J > F)
   - J > E
   - E < C (which means C > E)
   - C > B
   - B < H (which means H > B)

2. From the second list:
   - B < H (which means H > B)
   - H > F
   - F < G (which means G > F)
   - G > J
   - J > E
   - E < I (which means I > E)
   - I < C (which means C > I)
   - C > A
   - A > D

3. From the third list:
   - J < G (which means G > J)
   - G > D
   - D < H (which means H > D)
   - H > F
   - F < E (which means E > F)
   - E < I (which means I > E)
   - I < C (which means C > I)
   - C > B
   - B < A (which means A > B)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is consistently greater than J, A, D, and F.
- C is consistently greater than I, E, A, B, and D.
- H is consistently greater than B, F, and D.
- I is consistently greater than E and D.
- J is consistently greater than E and F.
- A is consistently greater than D and B.
- E is consistently greater than F.
- B is consistently less than H and A.

By combining these observations, we can deduce the following order:

G > C > I > J > H > E > A > F > D > B

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > C > I > J > H > E > A > F > D > B
