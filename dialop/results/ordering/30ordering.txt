To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships between the items and establish a consistent ranking.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A < I
   - I > G
   - G < B
   - B < H
   - H > E
   - E > C
   - C < J
   - J > D
   - D < F

2. From the second list:
   - E < H
   - H < F
   - F > J
   - J > C
   - C < I
   - I > D
   - D < G
   - G < A
   - A < B

3. From the third list:
   - D < H
   - H > B
   - B > J
   - J < F
   - F > C
   - C < I
   - I > A
   - A > E
   - E < G

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that F is consistently ranked higher than many other items (F > J, F > C, F > D, F > H).
- H is consistently ranked higher than B, E, and D.
- I is consistently ranked higher than A, C, D, and G.
- J is consistently ranked higher than C and D.
- B is ranked higher than A and J.
- G is ranked higher than E and D.
- A is ranked higher than E.
- E is ranked higher than C.

By combining these observations, we can establish the following order:

F > H > B > J > I > G > A > E > C > D

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

F > H > B > J > I > G > A > E > C > D
