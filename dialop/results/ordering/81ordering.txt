To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and construct a consistent ordering. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - A > B
   - B > F
   - F < H (which means H > F)
   - H < I (which means I > H)
   - I > D
   - D < G (which means G > D)
   - G > C
   - C > J
   - J < E (which means E > J)

2. From the second list:
   - E > H
   - H > J
   - J < G (which means G > J)
   - G > F
   - F < B (which means B > F)
   - B < I (which means I > B)
   - I > C
   - C < A (which means A > C)
   - A > D

3. From the third list:
   - B < G (which means G > B)
   - G > H
   - H > C
   - C < E (which means E > C)
   - E < A (which means A > E)
   - A > F
   - F > J
   - J < D (which means D > J)
   - D < I (which means I > D)

Now, let's consolidate these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that A is consistently greater than many other items (B, C, E, F, D), suggesting A is one of the largest.
- I is greater than A, B, D, H, and C, indicating I is very large.
- G is greater than B, D, F, H, J, and C, suggesting G is also very large.
- E is greater than H, J, and C, but less than A, indicating E is smaller than A but larger than several others.
- B is less than A, I, and G, but greater than F and J.
- F is less than B, G, H, and A, but greater than J.
- H is less than I and G, but greater than F and C.
- C is less than A, E, H, and I, but greater than J.
- J is less than E, G, F, and D, making it one of the smallest.
- D is less than A, G, and I, but greater than J.

Considering these relationships, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

I > G > A > E > B > H > F > D > C > J
