To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - G < F
   - F > D
   - D > A
   - A > B
   - B < I
   - I > C
   - C > J
   - J < E
   - E > H

2. From the second list:
   - D > C
   - C > G
   - G < J
   - J < F
   - F > B
   - B > H
   - H < I
   - I > A
   - A < E

3. From the third list:
   - E > J
   - J < C
   - C > G
   - G < H
   - H < I
   - I > F
   - F > B
   - B < A
   - A < D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that E is greater than J, C, G, H, I, F, B, A, and D. Therefore, E is the largest.
- I is greater than F, B, A, C, G, H, and J.
- F is greater than D, B, A, C, G, and J.
- D is greater than A, B, C, G, and J.
- A is greater than B, C, G, and J.
- C is greater than G and J.
- G is greater than J.
- B is greater than H.
- J is the smallest.

Combining all these, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

E > I > F > D > A > C > G > B > H > J
