To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - H > F > I < D > A > J > E < C < G > B

2. From the second list:
   - A < B < G > F < D > I < H > E < J < C

3. From the third list:
   - D > J > I < B > E < F < C < G > H > A

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- G is consistently greater than C, E, F, B, and A.
- H is consistently greater than F, I, E, and A.
- D is consistently greater than J, I, F, and A.
- C is consistently greater than E, F, and J.
- B is consistently greater than E and A.
- A is consistently less than B, D, G, H, and J.
- J is consistently greater than I and less than D and C.
- I is consistently less than D, H, and J.
- F is consistently less than D, G, and H.
- E is consistently less than B, C, and H.

From these observations, we can deduce the overall order:

G > H > D > C > J > B > F > I > E > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

G > H > D > C > J > B > F > I > E > A
