To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative positions of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - D < B
   - B > F
   - F < J
   - J < I
   - I > A
   - A < H
   - H < G
   - G < E
   - E > C

2. From the second list:
   - H > F
   - F < E
   - E < I
   - I > G
   - G > C
   - C > D
   - D < A
   - A < J
   - J > B

3. From the third list:
   - F < B
   - B < A
   - A > D
   - D < C
   - C > J
   - J < G
   - G > H
   - H < I
   - I > E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the first list, we have: E > G > H > A > I > J > F > B > D > C
- From the second list, we have: I > E > G > C > J > A > H > F > B > D
- From the third list, we have: I > G > J > C > A > B > F > H > E > D

By combining these comparisons, we can deduce the overall order:

I > E > G > J > C > A > H > B > F > D

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > E > G > J > C > A > H > B > F > D
