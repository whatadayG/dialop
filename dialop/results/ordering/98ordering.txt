To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - I < D
   - D > C
   - C < B
   - B > J
   - J < F
   - F > E
   - E < H
   - H > G
   - G > A

2. From the second list:
   - B > I
   - I > J
   - J < G
   - G < C
   - C < F
   - F < D
   - D > E
   - E < H
   - H > A

3. From the third list:
   - A < D
   - D > I
   - I < B
   - B > J
   - J < F
   - F > C
   - C > G
   - G < H
   - H > E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that D is consistently greater than many other items (I, C, F, E, A), suggesting D is one of the largest items.
- H is greater than E, G, and A in multiple comparisons, suggesting H is also quite large.
- B is greater than I, J, and C in multiple comparisons, suggesting B is also large.
- F is greater than C, J, and E in multiple comparisons.
- C is greater than G and A in multiple comparisons.
- G is greater than A in multiple comparisons.

Combining these insights, we can deduce the following order:

D > H > B > F > C > G > I > J > E > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

D > H > B > F > C > G > I > J > E > A
