To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and deduce a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - B < H
   - H > J
   - J > A
   - A < C
   - C < I
   - I > E
   - E > G
   - G < D
   - D > F

2. From the second list:
   - D < E
   - E > G
   - G < H
   - H > B
   - B > A
   - A < F
   - F < C
   - C < I
   - I > J

3. From the third list:
   - E > C
   - C < I
   - I > G
   - G > A
   - A < J
   - J > B
   - B < H
   - H > F
   - F < D

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is consistently greater than most other items (I > C, I > E, I > J, I > G).
- H is also consistently greater than many items (H > J, H > B, H > F, H > G).
- E is greater than C, G, and D.
- C is greater than A and F.
- J is greater than A and B.
- D is greater than F and G.
- B is greater than A.
- G is greater than A.

By analyzing these relationships, we can deduce the following order:

I > H > E > C > J > D > G > B > F > A

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > H > E > C > J > D > G > B > F > A
