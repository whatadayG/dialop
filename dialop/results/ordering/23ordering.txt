To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - J > C
   - C < B (implies B > C)
   - B > G
   - G > E
   - E < A (implies A > E)
   - A < H (implies H > A)
   - H > F
   - F > D
   - D < I (implies I > D)

2. From the second list:
   - G < H (implies H > G)
   - H > F
   - F > E
   - E < A (implies A > E)
   - A < D (implies D > A)
   - D > B
   - B > C
   - C < J (implies J > C)
   - J < I (implies I > J)

3. From the third list:
   - D > A
   - A > C
   - C > E
   - E < J (implies J > E)
   - J < F (implies F > J)
   - F < H (implies H > F)
   - H > B
   - B < I (implies I > B)
   - I > G

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that I is greater than D, J, B, and G.
- H is greater than F, G, A, and B.
- F is greater than J, E, and D.
- J is greater than C and E.
- D is greater than A and B.
- B is greater than C and G.
- A is greater than C and E.
- G is greater than E.

By combining all these, we can deduce the overall order:

I > H > F > J > D > A > B > G > C > E

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

I > H > F > J > D > A > B > G > C > E
