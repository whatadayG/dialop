To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C > B
   - B < H (which implies H > B)
   - H < G (which implies G > H)
   - G > F
   - F > E
   - E > D
   - D < J (which implies J > D)
   - J > A
   - A < I (which implies I > A)

2. From the second list:
   - E > D
   - D < G (which implies G > D)
   - G > J
   - J < H (which implies H > J)
   - H < C (which implies C > H)
   - C > A
   - A < I (which implies I > A)
   - I < F (which implies F > I)
   - F > B

3. From the third list:
   - I < C (which implies C > I)
   - C > F
   - F < G (which implies G > F)
   - G > A
   - A < E (which implies E > A)
   - E > H
   - H > J
   - J > D
   - D < B (which implies B > D)

Now, let's combine these comparisons to determine the overall order:

- From the comparisons, we can see that G is consistently greater than many other items (H, F, J, D, A), suggesting it is one of the largest.
- C is also consistently greater than many items (B, H, A, F, I), suggesting it is also one of the largest.
- F is greater than B, I, and E, but less than G and C.
- E is greater than A, H, D, and B, but less than F.
- H is greater than J and B, but less than G, C, and E.
- J is greater than D and A, but less than H and G.
- I is greater than A, but less than C and F.
- B is greater than D, but less than C, H, F, and E.
- A is less than E, J, I, G, and C.
- D is less than E, J, G, and B.

Based on these observations, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

G > C > F > E > H > J > I > B > D > A
