To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships given in the lists and find a consistent ordering that satisfies all the comparisons.

Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C < H < I > J < B < E > D > A < G < F

2. From the second list:
   - A < J < B < I > F > G > D < E > C < H

3. From the third list:
   - C > J < H > B > G < F > D < I > A < E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- From the first list, we have a partial order: C < H < I > J < B < E > D > A < G < F
- From the second list, we have: A < J < B < I > F > G > D < E > C < H
- From the third list, we have: C > J < H > B > G < F > D < I > A < E

By combining these, we can deduce the following order:

1. Start with the largest item, which appears to be E, as it is greater than many other items in all lists.
2. Next, we have I, which is consistently greater than many other items.
3. Followed by F, which is greater than G and D in multiple lists.
4. Then H, which is greater than C and B in multiple lists.
5. Next is B, which is greater than J and G.
6. Then G, which is greater than D and A.
7. Followed by D, which is greater than A.
8. Then C, which is greater than J.
9. Next is J, which is greater than A.
10. Finally, the smallest item is A.

Thus, the overall order from largest to smallest is:

E > I > F > H > B > G > D > C > J > A
