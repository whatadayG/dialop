To determine the overall order of the items from the given comparisons, we need to analyze the relationships and find a consistent ranking. Let's break down the comparisons:

1. From the first list:
   - C > I > A < J > H < B < E > G > D < F

2. From the second list:
   - D < J > C < E > H < B > G > A < I > F

3. From the third list:
   - B > I > D < G > F < C < E > A > H < J

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

- J is consistently greater than C, A, H, D, and F.
- E is consistently greater than C, H, B, A, and F.
- B is consistently greater than I, G, H, and F.
- C is consistently greater than I, A, and F.
- G is consistently greater than D and F.
- I is consistently greater than A, D, and F.
- A is consistently greater than H.
- D is consistently less than J, G, and I.
- F is consistently less than C, G, and I.

By analyzing these relationships, we can determine the overall order:

J > E > B > C > I > G > A > H > D > F

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:

J > E > B > C > I > G > A > H > D > F
