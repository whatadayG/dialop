To determine the overall order of the items from the comparisons, we need to analyze the given comparisons and deduce the relative order of each item. Let's break down the comparisons:

From the first list:
- F > H > E < G < D < A > I < J > B > C

From the second list:
- B > G > E < A > C > D < J > I > H < F

From the third list:
- C < I < B > D > G > H < A > J > F > E

Now, let's combine these comparisons to find a consistent order:

1. Start with the items that appear to be consistently larger:
   - F appears to be larger than H, E, and J.
   - A appears to be larger than J, H, G, D, C, and E.

2. Next, consider items that are consistently smaller:
   - C appears to be smaller than B, A, and D.
   - E appears to be smaller than F, G, and A.

3. Combine the information:
   - F > H, E, J
   - A > J, H, G, D, C, E
   - B > G, D, C
   - J > I, F
   - I > H
   - D > G, C
   - G > E, H
   - H > E

4. From the above, we can deduce the following order:
   - A > J > F > B > D > G > I > H > C > E

Therefore, the overall order from the largest item to the smallest item is:
A > J > F > B > D > G > I > H > C > E
