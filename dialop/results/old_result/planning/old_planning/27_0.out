USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.
You: [accept] 
FINAL SCORE: 92/100

You:[message] I'd like to see some panoramic views of the city, eat at Korean or Chinese restaurants with vegan options and outdoor seating. I'd also like to stop by Hindenberg Memorial and at least one museum. I'd prefer places with wifi, parking, and that are reservable in advance. I also like hipster places. Please keep the travel distance to a minimum.<
