USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

You: [message] It's not bad so far, I'd really like to stop by Mad Seoul though.
Agent: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
You: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
Agent: [message] I have one option for you that you might be interested in. However, it is not recommended for kids. Are there any other places?
You: [message] Somewhere with a panoramic view of the city would be nice or somewhere that's kid-friendly in general.
Agent: [message] I have several options available. Do you have a price point?
You: [message] As long as it's $30 or under, it should be fine.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
go to at least one park
check out live music!
would love to see some panoramic views of the city
prefer just eating takeout
don't like: spanish, like: ethiopian, korean
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
prefer ratings above 4
keep budget below $80
definitely want to go to A-Trane
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to go to a park, see some live music, and enjoy a panoramic view of the city. I prefer takeout from Ethiopian or Korean restaurants and I'd like to visit A-Trane. I'm traveling with a group of 7, so places good for groups would be best. I'd also like places with outdoor seating and ratings above 4. My budget is $80.
Agent: [message] I found two parks that are good for groups: Riverside Trail and Moabit Garden. However, neither of them have a panoramic view of the city. Would you like to visit one of these parks or should I look for a different type of place that has a panoramic view?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with Riverside Trail. I'd also like to visit a place with a panoramic view if possible.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any places with a panoramic view. Would you like me to look for a place with live music instead?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, that would be great. I'd also like to visit A-Trane if possible.
Agent: [message] I found several places with live music that are also good for groups: The Dive, Mad Seoul, Caribbean Corner, and Kozy Kar. However, A-Trane was not in the search results. Would you like to visit one of these places or should I look for A-Trane specifically?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with Caribbean Corner for the live music. But I'd really like to visit A-Trane if you can find it.
Agent: [message] I found A-Trane, but it's not listed as being good for groups. Would you still like to visit it?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, I'd still like to visit A-Trane. Let's add that to the itinerary.
Agent: [message] I found two restaurants that offer takeout and are good for groups: Saul's and The Dockside Grill. However, neither of them offer Ethiopian or Korean cuisine. Would you like to visit one of these restaurants or should I look for a different type of place?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with The Dockside Grill for the restaurant. I think that should cover all our bases.
