USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

would be great if everything is reservable in advance
would love to see some panoramic views of the city
keep budget below $50
like: cocktails
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups

You:[message] I'd like to go to at least one bar, preferably one that serves cocktails. I'd also like to visit some hidden, non-touristy spots and places with outdoor seating due to COVID. I've heard good things about Market Street and would like to check it out. I'd also like to see some panoramic views of the city. My budget is $50 and I'll be traveling with a group of 7.
