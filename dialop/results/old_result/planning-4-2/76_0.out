USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several places that meet your requirements. Schwarzes Cafe and Common Grounds both offer vegetarian options and have wifi. They are also good for groups. Liberty Memorial is a landmark that you can visit. All of these places are within your budget.You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[think] The travel distance between the places is too far and is causing a significant decrease in the score. I should reject this proposal and ask the agent to find places that are closer to each other.
