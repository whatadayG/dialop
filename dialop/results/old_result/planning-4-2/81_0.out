USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to go to places that are good for groups. We're renting a car, so places with parking would be great. We'd like to see some panoramic views of the city and visit at least one museum. We're not fans of cocktails, but we do like wine. We generally prefer vegetarian options and Korean food, but not kosher. We also need a place with wifi to do some work. We're not interested in live music and our budget is $30.

You:[think] The user has a lot of preferences. I'll start by searching for places that are good for groups and have parking. Then I'll look for a place with a panoramic view and a museum.

Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the itinerary you agreed on matches your preferences. You should not list all your preferences up front in the conversation.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

You:[message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to go to places that are good for groups. We're renting a car, so places with parking would be great. We'd like to see some panoramic views of the city and visit at least one museum. We're not fans of cocktails, but we do like wine. We generally prefer vegetarian options and Korean food, but not kosher. We also need a place with wifi to do some work. We're not interested in live music and our budget is $30.
Agent: [message] I have found several places that meet your preferences. Vista Ridge Mall and The Dockside Grill are good for groups and have parking. Riverside Trail has a panoramic view of the city. BAMPFA is a museum that also has parking. Mad Seoul serves Korean food and Common Grounds has wifi. However, I couldn't find a place that serves wine. Would you like me to make a proposal based on these options?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
