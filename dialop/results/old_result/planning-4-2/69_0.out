USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.
You: [accept]

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
generally like eating vegetarian options
family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids

would be great if everything is reservable in advance
heard good things about City Museum of Art
prefer places rated above 3 stars
go to at least one museum
keep budget below $40
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok

minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit the City Museum of Art and at least one other museum. I'd also like to find a place with wifi where I can do some work. I prefer places that are good for kids, have parking, and are rated above 3 stars. Outdoor seating would be best due to COVID. My budget is $40.
Agent: [message] I found a museum near the City Museum of Art, but it doesn't meet all your preferences. It's not good for kids and doesn't have outdoor seating. Let's try to find another museum.You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect

You:[message] The Historical Society museum doesn't seem to be a good fit. Could you find another museum that's more suitable for kids and has a higher rating?
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find another museum that meets all your preferences. Would you like to consider other types of places that are good for kids and have a high rating?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] That's fine. Let's look for other types of places that are good for kids and have a high rating.
Agent: [message] I found a few places that are good for kids and have a high rating. The Tower is a landmark that is close to the City Museum of Art. It has parking and a high rating, but it doesn't have outdoor seating. Coffee Nook is a cafe that is also good for kids and has a high rating, but it doesn't have parking or outdoor seating. Would you like to consider these options?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, those options sound good. Let's add them to the itinerary.
