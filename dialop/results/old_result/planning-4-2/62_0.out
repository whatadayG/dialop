USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

You:[message] I'd like to visit places with a rating of 3 stars or above, with a definite stop at Market Street. I'd prefer outdoor seating due to COVID, and I'd like to visit at least one shop. I enjoy beer and vegan options, and the places should be kid-friendly. I'd also like to see some hidden, non-touristy spots. I'll be renting a car, so parking is a must. I'll also need a place with wifi to do some work. Please keep the travel distance to a minimum.
Agent: [message] I found a place called The Cupcake Bar that meets most of your preferences. It has a rating of 4 stars, parking, and wifi. However, it doesn't have outdoor seating. Would you like me to include this in your itinerary?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, please include The Cupcake Bar in the itinerary. I can make do without the outdoor seating for this one.<
