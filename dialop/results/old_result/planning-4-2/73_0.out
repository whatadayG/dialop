USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

You:[message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to visit places that are good for groups. We're interested in hidden, non-touristy spots and we'd like to keep our budget below $30. We've heard good things about The Cakery and Lucia's and we'd like to visit at least one cafe. We're also interested in checking out some live music. Can you help us plan our day?
Agent: [message] I found two cafes that are good for groups and have a hidden, hipster ambience. The Coffee Nook and The Cupcake Bar both fit your budget. Would you like to visit one of these?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, that sounds great. We'd also like to check out some live music if possible.
Agent: [message] I found several places with live music that are good for groups. The Dockside Grill is the most affordable option and also offers outdoor seating. Would you like to include this in your itinerary?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, that sounds like a good option. We'd also like to visit The Cakery and Lucia's if possible.
Agent: [message] The Cakery is a good fit for your group and it's within your budget. However, Lucia's may not be the best fit as it's not particularly group-friendly and it's over your budget. Would you like to replace Lucia's with another place or increase your budget?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] We can replace Lucia's with another place. Do you have any suggestions?
Agent: [message] I found several places that are good for groups and within your budget. The Tower, Harper and Rye, Liberty Memorial, Hindenberg Memorial, and Schwarzes Cafe are all options. Do any of these sound appealing to you?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] The Tower and Harper and Rye sound interesting. Let's include those in our itinerary.
