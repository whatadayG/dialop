USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

no live music places, generally too loud
like: french, american, thai, spanish, ethiopian, korean, kosher

COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to eat takeout from French, American, Thai, Spanish, Ethiopian, Korean, or kosher restaurants. I'd like to keep my budget under $30 and prefer places with ratings above 4. I don't want to go to any live music places as they're generally too loud. I'd like to visit at least one cafe and specifically Asha Tea House. This is a family trip so kid-friendly places are best. I'm also COVID conscious so places with outdoor seating would be great. Lastly, I'd like to minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I found a Thai restaurant that fits your preferences. It's called El Toro Steakhouse, it's kid-friendly, doesn't have live music, and it's open late. Now, let's find a cafe near Asha Tea House.
You:[message] That sounds great. I'd also like to visit a place with outdoor seating if possible.
Agent: [message] I found a cafe called Common Grounds that is kid-friendly and has outdoor seating. It's also close to Asha Tea House. Now, let's find a third place that fits your preferences.
You:[message] That sounds perfect. For the third place, I'd like to try a different cuisine, maybe French or Spanish. And remember, it should be kid-friendly and have outdoor seating.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any French or Spanish restaurants that meet all your criteria. Would you like to try another cuisine or adjust some of your preferences?
You:[message] That's okay, let's try an American or Korean restaurant then. The kid-friendly and outdoor seating criteria are still important.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any American or Korean restaurants that meet all your criteria. Would you like to try another cuisine or adjust some of your preferences?
You:[message] That's alright, let's try an Ethiopian restaurant then. The kid-friendly and outdoor seating criteria are still important.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Ethiopian restaurants that meet all your criteria. Would you like to try another cuisine or adjust some of your preferences?
You:[message] That's unfortunate. Let's try a kosher restaurant then. The kid-friendly and outdoor seating criteria are still important.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any kosher restaurants that meet all your criteria. Would you like to try another cuisine or adjust some of your preferences?
You:[message] That's okay. Let's stick with the Thai and cafe for now. Can you find a third place that's kid-friendly and has outdoor seating, regardless of the cuisine?
Agent: [message] I found another place that fits your criteria. It's called El Toro Steakhouse. It's a family-friendly Thai restaurant that offers outdoor seating and is known for its late-night service. It also offers takeout options. So, your itinerary could be Asha Tea House, Common Grounds, and El Toro Steakhouse. What do you think?
You:[message] That sounds great! I'm happy with that itinerary.
