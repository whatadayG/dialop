User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject]

definitely want to go to Liberty Memorial
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok
go to at least one park
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to see some live music, eat at Ethiopian or Korean restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Liberty Memorial. I'd also like places with parking, visit at least one park and somewhere that's kid-friendly. My budget is $90.
Agent: [message] I found a Korean restaurant named Mad Seoul that has vegan options and parking. Now, let's find a park that is kid-friendly and close to this restaurant.
You:[message] That sounds great! I'd also like to minimize travel distance if possible.
Agent: [message] I found two parks that are kid-friendly and have parking. Moabit Garden is 0.8 miles away from Mad Seoul and Garden of Wonders is 1.2 miles away. Which one would you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with Moabit Garden since it's closer.
Agent: [message] I found three bars with live music that are within your budget. However, only A-Trane has parking available. It's a bit more expensive but still within your budget. Would you like to go there?
You:[message] Yes, A-Trane sounds good. As long as it's within budget and has parking, it should be fine.

Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Korean or Ethiopian restaurants with vegan options and parking that are close to Liberty Memorial. Would you like to consider other types of cuisine or should I search again with a larger radius?
You:[message] Let's try searching again with a larger radius. I'd really like to stick to Korean or Ethiopian cuisine if possible.
Agent: [message] I found a restaurant named Mad Seoul that is a bit further from Liberty Memorial but it meets all your preferences. Now, let's find a park and a bar that are close to this restaurant.
You:[message] That sounds good. Please find a park and a bar that are as close as possible to Mad Seoul.
