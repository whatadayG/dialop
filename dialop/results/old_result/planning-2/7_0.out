User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

check out live music!
keep budget below $90
don't like: spanish, american, like: ethiopian, korean

definitely want to go to Liberty Memorial
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok
go to at least one park
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to see some live music, eat at Ethiopian or Korean restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Liberty Memorial. I'd also like places with parking, visit at least one park and somewhere that's kid-friendly. My budget is $90.
Agent: [message] I found a Korean restaurant named Mad Seoul that has vegan options and parking. Now, let's find a park that is kid-friendly and close to this restaurant.
You:[message] That sounds great! I'd also like to minimize travel distance if possible.
Agent: [message] I found two parks that are kid-friendly and have parking. Moabit Garden is 0.8 miles away from Mad Seoul and Garden of Wonders is 1.2 miles away. Which one would you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with Moabit Garden since it's closer.
Agent: [message] I found three bars with live music that are within your budget. However, only A-Trane has parking available. It's a bit more expensive but still within your budget. Would you like to go there?
You:[message] Yes, A-Trane sounds good. As long as it's within budget and has parking, it should be fine.

Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Korean or Ethiopian restaurants with vegan options and parking that are close to Liberty Memorial. Would you like to consider other types of cuisine or should I search again with a larger radius?
You:[message] Let's try searching again with a larger radius. I'd really like to stick to Korean or Ethiopian cuisine if possible.
Agent: [message] I found a restaurant named Mad Seoul that is a bit further from Liberty Memorial but it meets all your preferences. Now, let's find a park and a bar that are close to this restaurant.
You:[message] That sounds good. Please find a park and a bar that are as close as possible to Mad Seoul.
