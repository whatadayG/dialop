USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
go to at least one museum
no live music places, generally too loud
generally like eating vegan options
like: korean
keep budget below $60
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
renting a car so preferably places with parking
definitely want to go to Kozy Kar
prefer places rated above 3 stars
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit at least one museum, eat vegan food from a Korean restaurant, and stop by Kozy Kar. I'd prefer places with outdoor seating, parking, and good for groups. I'd like to avoid live music and places rated below 3 stars. My budget is $60.
Agent: [message] I found a restaurant called The Dockside Grill that has outdoor seating and parking. However, it doesn't serve Korean food and doesn't have vegan options. Would you like me to look for another restaurant or should we move on to finding a museum?
You:[message] Please find another restaurant. Korean food and vegan options are important to me.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Korean restaurants with vegan options. Would you like me to look for a different type of restaurant or should we move on to finding a museum?
You:[message] Let's move on to finding a museum for now. We can circle back to the restaurant later.
Agent: [message] I found two museums. The BAMPFA is kid-friendly and open late, but it doesn't have parking. The Historical Society is good for groups and has parking, but it's rated below 3 stars. Which one would you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with the BAMPFA. We can manage without parking. Now, could you find a restaurant that, while may not be Korean, offers vegan options and is good for groups?
Agent: [message] I found two restaurants that offer vegan options and are good for groups. Mad Seoul serves Japanese cuisine and Caribbean Corner is open late. Which one would you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with Mad Seoul. Now, can you find a place that's good for groups and has outdoor seating?
Agent: [message] I found several places that are good for groups and have outdoor seating. However, some of them have live music which you wanted to avoid. The Coffee Nook is a cafe that also has vegan options and parking. Kozy Kar is a bar that you mentioned earlier and it also has parking. Atlas Park is a park that is good for kids and has a viewpoint. Which one would you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with Kozy Kar since I wanted to visit there. Now, can you propose an itinerary with these places?
