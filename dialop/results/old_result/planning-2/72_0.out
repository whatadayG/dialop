USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

I'm traveling with a group of 7, so places good for groups would be ideal. I'd also like to visit at least one park and places that are good for kids. My budget is $80.

category: can be [restaurant, cafe, museum, bar, landmark, park, shop]

Parameters
- fields: list of field names to return
- filters: list of filters to intersect with AND. Can only filter one of the
  fields above.
- text_query: freeform text query to search in event descriptions. Will be intersected with filters with AND.
- sort_by: list of fields or callable function to sort results by.
- limit: number of results to return

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

You:[message] I'd like to visit Cookies Cream and Saul's as recommended by Dan. I prefer Japanese and Ethiopian food and would like to avoid French, seafood, and Spanish cuisine. I'm traveling with a group of 7, so places good for groups would be ideal. I'd also like to visit at least one park and places that are good for kids. My budget is $80. I'd prefer to avoid hipster places and would like to have vegan options. I also need a place with wifi to do some work. Please minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I found a park that is good for kids and groups, and is close to Cookies Cream and Saul's. It's called Atlas Park. Would you like to visit this park?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds great. As long as it's within budget and not too far from the restaurants, we'd love to visit Atlas Park.
Agent: [message] I found a cafe called Common Grounds that has wifi and is very close to Cookies Cream, Saul's, and Atlas Park. Would you like to visit this cafe?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds perfect. As long as it's not a hipster place and has vegan options, we'd love to visit Common Grounds.
Agent: [message] Common Grounds is not a hipster place and it is good for groups. However, it doesn't specifically mention vegan options. Would you still like to visit this cafe?
You:[message] As long as there are some vegetarian options, that should be fine. Let's include Common Grounds in our itinerary.

You:[message] The travel distance is a bit high and Cookies Cream doesn't seem to have vegetarian options. Could you find a closer alternative to Cookies Cream with vegetarian options?
