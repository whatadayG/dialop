USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to visit places that are good for groups and have parking.

We'd also like to find a place with wifi to do some work. We're not interested in live music places as they're generally too loud. Our budget is $30 and we'd like to minimize travel distance.

USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

You:[message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to visit places that are good for groups and have parking. We'd love to see some panoramic views of the city and visit at least one museum.

You:[think] The score is quite low, and the last place doesn't have wifi which I need. I should reject this proposal and ask the agent to find a place with wifi.

You:[message] The places you've chosen are good, but Common Grounds doesn't have wifi which I need. Could you find another place that does?
Agent: [message] I found another place that has wifi and meets your other preferences. Schwarzes Cafe is good for groups, has parking, doesn't have live music, and has vegetarian options. Would you like to replace Common Grounds with Schwarzes Cafe in the itinerary?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds like a good replacement. Let's see how that changes the itinerary.
