USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You: [message] It's not bad so far, I'd really like to stop by Mad Seoul though.
Agent: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
You: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
Agent: [message] I have one option for you that you might be interested in. However, it is not recommended for kids. Are there any other places?
You: [message] Somewhere with a panoramic view of the city would be nice or somewhere that's kid-friendly in general.
Agent: [message] I have several options available. Do you have a price point?
You: [message] As long as it's $30 or under, it should be fine.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
go to at least one park

hidden spots much better than tourist traps
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups

minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit Asha Tea House, a park, and a place with wifi where I can work. I'd also like to see some panoramic views of the city. I prefer hidden spots over tourist traps and places that are good for groups and kids. I enjoy cocktails, wine, and beer and prefer vegan options. My budget is $40.
Agent: [message] I found several parks and cafes near Asha Tea House. Do you have a preference for a park or a cafe?
You:[message] I'd like to visit a park first and then maybe a cafe where I can do some work.
Agent: [message] I found two parks near Asha Tea House that are good for groups and kids. However, I couldn't find any cafes with wifi nearby. Would you like to visit Lincoln Park or The Arboretum?
You:[message] Let's go with Lincoln Park. As for the cafe, as long as it's a quiet place where I can do some work, it doesn't necessarily need to have wifi.
Agent: [message] I found several cafes near Asha Tea House. Common Grounds is good for kids, while Schwarzes Cafe and Coffee Nook are quieter places. Which one do you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with Schwarzes Cafe. It sounds like a good place to get some work done.
