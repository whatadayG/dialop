USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] I'd like to keep my budget below $70 and prefer hidden spots over tourist traps. It's a family trip so kid-friendly places are a must. I'd like to go to at least one restaurant with outdoor seating due to COVID. I'm renting a car so places with parking would be great. I'd also like to check out some live music and visit either the City Museum of Art or BAMPFA. A place with a panoramic view of the city would be nice too. Please keep the travel distance to a minimum.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
keep budget below $70
hidden spots much better than tourist traps
family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
go to at least one restaurant
renting a car so preferably places with parking
would be great if everything is reservable in advance
check out live music!
heard these museums were good: City Museum of Art, BAMPFA
would love to see some panoramic views of the city
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to keep my budget below $70 and prefer hidden spots over tourist traps. It's a family trip so kid-friendly places are a must. I'd like to go to at least one restaurant with outdoor seating due to COVID. I'm renting a car so places with parking would be great. I'd also like to check out some live music and visit either the City Museum of Art or BAMPFA. A place with a panoramic view of the city would be nice too. Please keep the travel distance to a minimum.
Agent: [message] I found a few places that are kid-friendly, have parking, and outdoor seating. The Dockside Grill is a restaurant that fits your criteria. Would you like to include this in your itinerary?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds great. I'd also like to visit either the City Museum of Art or BAMPFA if possible.
Agent: [message] The BAMPFA is closer to The Dockside Grill than the City Museum of Art. Would you like to include this in your itinerary?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds good. I'd also like to check out some live music if there's any nearby.
Agent: [message] I found a few places with live music. However, most of them are bars and may not be suitable for kids. Mad Seoul is a restaurant that has live music and is kid-friendly, but it doesn't have parking. Would you like to include this in your itinerary?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds good. I'd also like to find a place with a panoramic view of the city if there's one nearby.
Agent: [message] I found a few places with a panoramic view of the city. Garden of Wonders is a park that is kid-friendly and has a good view, but it doesn't have parking. Would you like to include this in your itinerary?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds good. Let's include the Garden of Wonders in the itinerary.
