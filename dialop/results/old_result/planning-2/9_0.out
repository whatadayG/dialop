USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'd like to visit hidden spots rather than tourist traps, and I'm interested in Japanese cuisine for takeout, preferably with vegetarian options. I'd like to visit the City Museum of Art and BAMPFA, as recommended by Dan. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a must, and we're a group of 7, so places good for groups would be ideal. We'd also like to visit at least one cafe. Romantic places are a plus, and it would be great if everything is reservable in advance. Please keep the travel distance to a minimum.

You:[message] I found a restaurant called Earthbar that accepts reservations and is good for kids. It does not have takeout, but it does have outdoor seating and is not a touristy spot. Would you like to consider this option?
User: [message] That sounds like a good option. Could you also find a cafe and the two places Dan recommended?
You:[think] I will now look for a cafe that is good for kids and groups, and is close to the City Museum of Art, BAMPFA, and Earthbar.

You:[message] I found a cafe called Common Grounds that is good for both kids and groups. It's close to the City Museum of Art, BAMPFA, and Earthbar. Would you like to consider this option?
User: [message] Yes, that sounds great. Could you also find a romantic spot that's not too far away?

You:[message] I found a few places that are good for both kids and groups. One of them is BAMPFA, which is a museum that also has parking and is open late. However, it is a touristy spot. Another option is Mad Seoul, a restaurant that has parking and takeout, but it's not kid-friendly. There are also two shops, The Mall and Market Street, that are good for groups but not for kids. Would you like to consider any of these options?
User: [message] BAMPFA sounds like a good option since it's one of Dan's recommendations. Let's skip Mad Seoul since it's not kid-friendly. As for the shops, are they close to the other places we're planning to visit?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject]

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
hidden spots much better than tourist traps
don't like: korean, chinese, french, spanish, like: japanese
definitely want to check out Dan's recommendations: City Museum of Art, BAMPFA
would be great if everything is reservable in advance
family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids
like romantic places
go to at least one cafe
generally like eating vegetarian options
prefer just eating takeout
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit hidden spots rather than tourist traps, and I'm interested in Japanese cuisine for takeout, preferably with vegetarian options. I'd like to visit the City Museum of Art and BAMPFA, as recommended by Dan. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a must, and we're a group of 7, so places good for groups would be ideal. We'd also like to visit at least one cafe. Romantic places are a plus, and it would be great if everything is reservable in advance. Please keep the travel distance to a minimum.
Agent: [message] I found a restaurant that is kid-friendly and has vegetarian options. However, it does not accept reservations and is not good for groups. Would you like to consider this option or should I look for another one?
You:[message] I think it would be best to find another option that can accommodate our group size and accepts reservations.
