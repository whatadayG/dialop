USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] The proposal is good but Central Plaza is a touristy place which I wanted to avoid. Also, the budget is not being maintained. Could you find a non-touristy shop and keep the budget under $80?
You:[think] I need to find a non-touristy shop that fits within the user's budget. I'll also make sure the total cost of the itinerary doesn't exceed $80.

You:[think] There are no non-touristy shops within the user's budget. I'll try to find a shop that is less touristy than others and still fits within the budget.

You:[message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any non-touristy shops within your budget. The least touristy shop I found is Vista Ridge Mall, but it's over your budget. Would you like to adjust your budget or preferences?
User: [message] I'd prefer to stick to my budget. If there are no non-touristy shops available, I'm open to other non-touristy locations.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

don't like romantic places
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best

heard these bars were good: A-Trane, The Dive
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit some hidden spots, preferably with panoramic views of the city. I'm not interested in romantic places. I'd like to go to at least one shop and I've heard good things about the bars A-Trane and The Dive. I'm renting a car, so places with parking would be best. I'm also COVID conscious, so outdoor seating would be ideal. I generally prefer vegan options and I'd like to keep my budget below $80. It would be great if everything is reservable in advance.
