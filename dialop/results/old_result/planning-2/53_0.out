USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

You:[message] I'm sorry, but the only restaurant I found that fits within your budget and has a good rating is Mad Seoul. However, it's significantly over your budget. Would you like me to look for other options?
User: [message] That's unfortunate. Let's stick with Caribbean Corner then. Could you propose an itinerary with these places?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
don't like: chinese, like: french
find a place with wifi to do some work at some point
go to at least one bar
prefer just eating takeout
keep budget below $90
definitely want to go to Garden of Wonders
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok
seeing hidden, non-touristy spots would be cool
prefer ratings above 4
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit the Garden of Wonders, eat takeout from French restaurants, and go to at least one bar. I also need a place with wifi to do some work. I prefer places with parking and non-touristy spots. I'd like to keep my budget under $90 and prefer places with ratings above 4. Please minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I found a place called Coffee Nook where you can work. It has wifi, parking, and a good rating. It's also not touristy and fits within your budget. Now, let's find a French restaurant and a bar for you.
You:[message] That sounds great. Please find a French restaurant that offers takeout and a bar that's not too touristy.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any French restaurants that meet your criteria. However, I found a bar called The Dive that has a good rating and fits within your budget. It doesn't have wifi or parking, though. Would you like me to look for other options?
You:[message] That's unfortunate about the French restaurant. The bar sounds good though. Could you find a restaurant that offers takeout and fits the other criteria? It doesn't have to be French.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any restaurants that meet all your criteria. However, I found a restaurant called Caribbean Corner that has a good rating and offers takeout. It's a bit over your budget and doesn't have wifi, though. Would you like me to look for other options?
