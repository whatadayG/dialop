USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

You can [think], or output one of these choices:

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

You:[message] I'd like to visit places that are COVID conscious with outdoor seating. I'd prefer to avoid live music as it can be too loud. I'd love to see some panoramic views of the city and visit at least one bar. My budget is $60. I enjoy trendy places and my drink preferences are beer and cocktails. I definitely want to go to Earthbar. I don't like Korean or American food, but I do like seafood, Ethiopian, and Japanese. Please minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I found several bars that are close to Earthbar. Some of them have outdoor seating and serve beer and cocktails. However, not all of them are COVID conscious. Do you have a preference for a specific type of bar?
You:[message] As long as the bar is trendy and serves beer and cocktails, I'm happy. Being COVID conscious is a must though.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any bars that are both trendy and COVID conscious near Earthbar. Would you like me to search again with different criteria?
You:[message] That's unfortunate. In that case, let's prioritize being COVID conscious and serving beer and cocktails. The bar doesn't necessarily have to be trendy.
