USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

You:[message] I'd like to go to a park, see some live music, and enjoy panoramic views of the city. I prefer takeout from Ethiopian or Korean restaurants, and I don't like Spanish food. I'm traveling with a group of 7, so places good for groups would be best. We're also COVID conscious, so outdoor seating is preferred. I'd like to visit places with ratings above 4, and I definitely want to go to A-Trane. My budget is $80, and I'd like to minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I found two parks that have ratings above 4: The Arboretum and Moabit Garden. Both have parking but are not particularly good for groups. Would you like to visit one of these parks?
You:[message] Yes, let's add one of those parks to the itinerary. I'd also like to make sure we visit A-Trane for some live music.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any restaurants that meet all your criteria and are close to A-Trane. Would you like me to search again with fewer criteria?
You:[message] Yes, please. Let's prioritize Korean or Ethiopian takeout, good for groups, and close to A-Trane. Outdoor seating would be a bonus but not a must.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Korean or Ethiopian restaurants that are good for groups and close to A-Trane. Would you like me to search for other types of cuisine?
