USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] I'd like to visit places with high ratings, preferably above 4.5. I've heard good things about Coffee Nook and Common Grounds, so I'd like to visit those. I'm on a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a must. My budget is $80. I prefer vegetarian and vegan options, and I like classy places. I'm not a fan of live music, as it's generally too loud. I'd also like to visit at least one shop. If possible, I'd like everything to be reservable in advance, and I'd like to minimize travel distance.

You:[think] The Cakery is the closest restaurant to both Coffee Nook and Common Grounds, and it has vegetarian options and is reservable. However, it doesn't have a high rating. I should propose an itinerary with these three places and see what the user thinks.

You:[think] The Hindenberg Memorial is a landmark with a high rating and is kid-friendly. It doesn't have vegetarian options or is reservable, but as a landmark, it might not need those. I should propose an itinerary with Coffee Nook, Common Grounds, and the Hindenberg Memorial.
You:[propose] [Coffee Nook, Common Grounds, Hindenberg Memorial]

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject]
