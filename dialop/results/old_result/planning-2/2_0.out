User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.
