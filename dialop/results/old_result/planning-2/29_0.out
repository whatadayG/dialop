USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
User: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
You: [think] I will try to find somewhere with live music near Mad Seoul and check whether the event also satisfies the other preferences the user listed.

User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
You: [think] Concert is not a category I can search by. I should look for a restaurant that is close to Mad Seoul and satisfies the user's preferences as much as possible.

User: [message] I'd like to find a place with a rating above 4 where I can do some work, preferably with wifi. I'd like to eat at Chinese, kosher, Thai, Ethiopian, American, or French restaurants, with vegetarian options. I'd like to avoid intimate places and Japanese, Spanish, and Korean food. I've heard good things about The Tower and would like to visit there. I'd also like to see hidden, non-touristy spots and go to at least one shop. I'm COVID conscious, so outdoor seating would be best. My budget is $40.
You: [message] I have found several options for you. The Cupcake Bar is a great place to work with a rating of 4.5 and wifi. For dining, The Dockside Grill is a restaurant with outdoor seating and a rating of 4.5, and it's close to The Tower. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a hidden shop, but Market Street is a shop that's also close to The Tower. Does this sound good to you?
User: [message] That sounds like a good start. Could you please find a restaurant that serves Chinese, kosher, Thai, Ethiopian, American, or French food? And please make sure the places are close to each other to minimize travel distance.
You: [message] I found a couple of restaurants that serve the cuisines you mentioned. The Cakery serves Chinese food and has a rating of 4.5, and Lucia's serves Ethiopian food. Both are close to The Tower. Would you like to try one of these?
User: [message] Yes, that sounds great. Let's go with The Cakery since it has a higher rating. Can you also find a non-touristy spot that's close by?
You: [message] I found several non-touristy spots near The Cakery. The Jazz Spot is a bar with outdoor seating, and The Arboretum is a park with parking. There's also The Mall, a shop that's good for kids and has parking. Which one would you prefer?
User: [message] Let's go with The Arboretum. It sounds like a nice place to relax after a meal. Can you also find a shop that's close by?

You: [message] I'd like to find a place with a rating above 4 where I can do some work, preferably with wifi.

USER 2.

User: [message] I'd like to find a place with a rating above 4 where I can do some work, preferably with wifi. I'd like to eat at Chinese, kosher, Thai, Ethiopian, American, or French restaurants, with vegetarian options. I'd like to avoid intimate places and Japanese, Spanish, and Korean food. I've heard good things about The Tower and would like to visit there. I'd also like to see hidden, non-touristy spots and go to at least one shop. I'm COVID conscious, so outdoor seating would be best. My budget is $40.
You: [message] I have found several options for you. The Cupcake Bar is a great place to work with a rating of 4.5 and wifi. For dining, The Dockside Grill is a restaurant with outdoor seating and a rating of 4.5, and it's close to The Tower. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a hidden shop, but Market Street is a shop that's also close to The Tower. Does this sound good to you?
User: [message] That sounds like a good start. Could you please find a restaurant that serves Chinese, kosher, Thai, Ethiopian, American, or French food? And please make sure the places are close to each other to minimize travel distance.
You: [message] I found a couple of restaurants that serve the cuisines you mentioned. The Cakery serves Chinese food and has a rating of 4.5, and Lucia's serves Ethiopian food. Both are close to The Tower. Would you like to try one of these?
User: [message] Yes, that sounds great. Let's go with The Cakery since it has a higher rating. Can you also find a non-touristy spot that's close by?
You: [message] I found several non-touristy spots near The Cakery. The Jazz Spot is a bar with outdoor seating, and The Arboretum is a park with parking. There's also The Mall, a shop that's good for kids and has parking. Which one would you prefer?
User: [message] Let's go with The Arboretum. It sounds like a nice place to relax after a meal. Can you also find a shop that's close by?

You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
