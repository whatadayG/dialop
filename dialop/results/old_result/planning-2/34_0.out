USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

We're also planning to go to Kozy Kar. We prefer outdoor seating and takeout food, and we're renting a car so places with parking would be great.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] I have found a few places that might interest you. The Mall is a shop that is good for groups and has parking. Common Grounds is a cafe that is good for groups, has parking, and wifi. These places are also close to Kozy Kar. Let me know what you think.
You:[think] The travel distance between the places is still too far and Common Grounds doesn't seem to be a good fit for us. I should reject this proposal and ask the agent to find places that are closer to each other and better suited for our group.
Error: A proposal was made. You must first accept or reject it.
You:[reject]
You:[message] The places you've chosen are nice, but the travel distance between them is a bit too far. Also, Common Grounds doesn't seem to be a good fit for our group. Could you find places that are closer to each other and better suited for our group?
Agent: [message] I have found three places that are good for groups, have parking, and are close to Kozy Kar. The Mall is a shop, and The Tower and Einstein's summer house are landmarks. Would these places be a better fit for your group?
You:[message] Yes, those sound like good options. As long as they're close to each other and within our budget, that should work.
Agent: [message] The Mall is a bit over your budget at $200. However, The Tower and Einstein's summer house are both free and $10 respectively. Would you like to replace The Mall with another place that is within your budget?
You:[message] Yes, please find a replacement for The Mall that fits within our budget.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but it seems there are no other shops that meet all your criteria. Would you be open to visiting a different type of place, such as a park or a museum?
You:[message] Yes, a park or a museum would be fine as long as it's good for groups and within our budget.
Agent: [message] I found a museum called BAMPFA that is good for groups and within your budget. However, it does not have parking. Would this be acceptable?
You:[message] Yes, that's fine. We can manage with street parking. Please include BAMPFA in our itinerary.
