USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
prefer places rated above 3 stars
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
don't like serious places
heard good things about City Museum of Art

family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids

go to at least one landmark
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit places that are rated above 3 stars and have outdoor seating. I'd also like to stop by the City Museum of Art and see some city views. I prefer places that aren't too serious and are good for kids. My budget is $30 and I'd like to minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I have found two places that meet your criteria and are close to the City Museum of Art. Schwarzes Cafe and The Cupcake Bar both have outdoor seating and are not too serious. However, The Cupcake Bar is not recommended for kids. Would you like to consider these options?
You:[message] I appreciate the suggestions, but I'd prefer places that are more kid-friendly. Also, I'd like to visit at least one landmark.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any landmarks that meet all your criteria. However, I can look for landmarks that are kid-friendly and not too serious. Would that be okay?
You:[message] Yes, that would be great. Just make sure it's within my budget and not too far from the other places.

Agent: [message] I have found a landmark that meets your criteria. The Tower is kid-friendly, not too serious, and is only 0.1 miles away from the City Museum of Art. Schwarzes Cafe is also nearby and has outdoor seating. This itinerary should fit within your budget. What do you think?
You:[think] The travel distance between the places is too far and is causing a significant loss in points. I should reject this proposal and ask the agent to find places that are closer to each other.
