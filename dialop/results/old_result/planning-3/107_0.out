USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Cookies Cream|4.5
El Toro Steakhouse|Not Rated
You:[message] Cookies Cream has a higher rating and is good for groups. I suggest we go with that one. Now, let's find a hidden, non-touristy spot.
User: [message] That sounds great. I'm looking forward to seeing what hidden gems you can find.

==================== Final user Prompt ====================

>You are traveling to a new city and consulting a travel agent. For each city, you have created a document listing things you would like to do and preferences about the places you visit. The preferences are not shared between cities. Communicate with the travel agent to find the best destinations to go to for the day.

Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the itinerary you agreed on matches your preferences. You should not list all your preferences up front in the conversation.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
keep budget below $60
generally like eating vegetarian options
prefer ratings above 4.5
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
go to at least one shop
don't like: french, japanese, chinese, korean, like: ethiopian
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
generally like eating vegan options
definitely want to go to Liberty Memorial
seeing hidden, non-touristy spots would be cool
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit Liberty Memorial and maybe a shop. I prefer places with outdoor seating and good for groups. I'd like to eat at Ethiopian restaurants with vegetarian or vegan options. I'd also like to see some hidden, non-touristy spots. My budget is $60.
Agent: [message] I found a few shops near Liberty Memorial. The Mall and Vista Ridge Mall are good for groups. Do you have a preference between these two?
You:[message] I don't have a preference between the two, as long as they have good ratings.
Agent: [message] The Mall has a higher rating than Vista Ridge Mall. I suggest we go with that one. Now, let's find an Ethiopian restaurant with vegetarian or vegan options.
You:[message] That sounds good. Just make sure the restaurant has outdoor seating and is good for groups.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Ethiopian restaurants with vegetarian or vegan options that also have outdoor seating and are good for groups. Would you like me to search for other types of restaurants that meet your criteria?
You:[message] That's unfortunate. Yes, please look for other types of restaurants that meet my criteria.
Agent: [message] I found a few restaurants that meet your criteria. Cookies Cream and El Toro Steakhouse are good for groups, but they don't have outdoor seating. Taqueria y Mas has outdoor seating, but it's not good for groups. Do you have a preference between these three?
You:[message] I think we should go with Cookies Cream or El Toro Steakhouse. I'd prefer a place that's good for groups.
Agent: [message] Cookies Cream has a higher rating and is good for groups. I suggest we go with that one. Now, let's find a hidden, non-touristy spot.
