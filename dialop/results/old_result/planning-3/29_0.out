USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

- limit: number of results to return

USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] I have made a proposal. Please let me know what you think of it.
User: [message] It's not bad so far, I'd really like to stop by Mad Seoul though.
You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
User: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
You: [think] I will try to find somewhere with live music near Mad Seoul and check whether the event also satisfies the other preferences the user listed.

You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Atlas Park]
You: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
You: [think] Concert is not a category I can search by. I should look for a restaurant that is close to Mad Seoul and satisfies the user's preferences as much as possible.

You: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
User: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]
You: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.

USER 2.

User: [message] I'd like to find a place with wifi where I can do some work, eat at a restaurant with vegetarian options and a rating above 4. I'd like to avoid Japanese, Spanish, and Korean food, but I do like Chinese, Kosher, Thai, Ethiopian, American, and French cuisine. I'd also like to visit The Tower and a shop. I prefer non-touristy spots and places with outdoor seating due to COVID. My budget is $40.
You:[think] The user has a lot of preferences. I will start by finding a place with wifi where they can work, then look for a restaurant that fits their criteria, and finally find a shop near The Tower.
