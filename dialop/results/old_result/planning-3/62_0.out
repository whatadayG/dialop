USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] I found a shop called Vista Ridge Mall near Market Street. It's rated 4.5 stars and is good for kids. However, it doesn't have wifi, outdoor seating, or parking. Would you like me to find another place or is this okay?
You:[message] That sounds great, but I really need a place with wifi where I can do some work. Could you find a place that meets that requirement?
Agent: [message] I found a few places with wifi where you can work. The Cupcake Bar and Schwarzes Cafe both have parking, but they are not kid-friendly. Common Grounds is kid-friendly and has a 5-star rating, but it doesn't have parking. Which one do you prefer?
You:[message] I think Common Grounds would be the best fit. I can manage without parking.
