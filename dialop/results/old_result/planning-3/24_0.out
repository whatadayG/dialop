USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You:[message] I'd like to visit Asha Tea House and Schwarzes Cafe, as recommended by Dan. I'd also like to eat takeout from an Ethiopian restaurant. Vegan options are a plus. I'd also like to visit a bar and places that are good for groups of 7. I prefer places with ratings above 4.5 and hipster places. My budget is $50.
Agent: [message] I found an Ethiopian restaurant called Lucia's that has vegan options and a rating of 4. It's not quite 4.5, but it's the highest rated Ethiopian restaurant I could find. I also found a bar called Harper and Rye, but it's not rated very highly and it's not good for groups. Would you like me to look for a different bar?
You:[message] Yes, please find a bar that's good for groups and has a higher rating.
Agent: [message] I found two bars that are good for groups and have a rating of 5: The Jazz Spot and Kozy Kar. Which one would you prefer?
You:[message] Let's go with The Jazz Spot.

Agent: [message] I have proposed an itinerary that includes Asha Tea House, Lucia's, and The Jazz Spot. These places are all good for groups and have vegan options. Let me know what you think.
You:[think] The travel distance between the places is still too far and is causing me to lose a lot of points. I should reject this proposal and ask the agent to find places that are closer to each other.

You:[reject]
You:[message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.
