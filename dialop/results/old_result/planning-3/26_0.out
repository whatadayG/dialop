USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
would love to see some panoramic views of the city
prefer ratings above 4.5
keep budget below $80
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
go to at least one park
hidden spots much better than tourist traps
definitely want to check out Dan's recommendations: Coffee Nook, The Cupcake Bar
generally like eating vegetarian options
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to see some panoramic views of the city, eat at places with ratings above 4.5 and outdoor seating. I'd also like to stop by Coffee Nook and The Cupcake Bar. I'd also like places that are good for groups, hidden spots and at least one park. My budget is $80.
Agent: [message] I have found a few places that match your preferences. They are all rated above 4.5 and have outdoor seating. Would you like to know more about them?
You:[message] Yes, please. I'd also like to make sure that the places are good for a group of 7.
Agent: [message] I have found two places that match your preferences. Common Grounds is a cafe with a rating of 4.5, has outdoor seating, and is good for groups. Kozy Kar is a bar with a rating of 5 and has outdoor seating, but it may not be suitable for large groups. Would you like to know more about these places?
You:[message] I'd like to know more about Common Grounds. Also, could you find a park that we could visit?
Agent: [message] Common Grounds is a cafe with a rating of 4.5, has outdoor seating, and is good for groups. It's a great place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. As for parks, Atlas Park, The Arboretum, and Lincoln Park are all good for groups. Lincoln Park has the highest rating among them. Would you like to know more about these parks?
You:[message] Yes, please tell me more about Lincoln Park. Also, I'd like to minimize travel distance between the places we visit.
Agent: [message] Lincoln Park is a great place for groups and kids. It has parking and a rating of 4. It's also a touristy spot. The park is right next to Coffee Nook and 2 miles away from The Cupcake Bar. Considering your preferences, I suggest visiting Coffee Nook, then Lincoln Park, and finally The Cupcake Bar. How does that sound?
You:[message] That sounds like a good plan. Could you also find a hidden spot that we could visit?
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any hidden spots that are good for groups and close to Coffee Nook and The Cupcake Bar. However, I can assure you that the places I suggested earlier are all excellent choices. Would you like to proceed with the plan?
You:[message] Yes, let's proceed with the plan.
