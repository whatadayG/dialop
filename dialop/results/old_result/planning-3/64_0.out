USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.

You:[message] I'd like to visit some classic touristy spots, preferably with parking. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a must.

I'd also like to see some panoramic views of the city. My budget is $90.

Agent: [message] I found several touristy spots near the Historical Society. The Tower and the Hindenberg Memorial are both kid-friendly landmarks. The Arboretum is a park that is also kid-friendly. Would you like to visit one of these places?
You:[message] Yes, those sound great. I'd love to visit the Tower for the panoramic views. The Arboretum sounds like a nice place to relax as well.
Agent: [message] I found several restaurants near The Tower. The Dockside Grill and Lucia's both have outdoor seating and are kid-friendly. El Toro Steakhouse also has outdoor seating and parking. Would you like to visit one of these restaurants?
