USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
go to at least one landmark
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok
keep budget below $90
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
prefer just eating takeout
prefer ratings above 4.5
hidden spots much better than tourist traps
heard these cafes were good: Schwarzes Cafe, Asha Tea House
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit at least one landmark and eat takeout from places with outdoor seating. I've heard Schwarzes Cafe and Asha Tea House are good. I'd like to go to places with parking and ratings above 4.5. I prefer hidden spots over tourist traps and my budget is $90.
