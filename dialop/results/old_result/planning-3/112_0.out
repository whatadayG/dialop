USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best

minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit the Artisan Street Fair and Central Plaza as recommended by Dan. I prefer takeout from kosher or American restaurants, with vegan or vegetarian options. Outdoor seating would be best due to COVID. I'd also like to see some city views, find a place with wifi to work, and keep the budget under $70. The places should be good for a group of 7 and close to each other.
Agent: [message] I found two restaurants that might meet your preferences. Mad Seoul offers kosher cuisine and outdoor seating, while Saul's has vegetarian options and is good for kids. Both are close to the Artisan Street Fair and Central Plaza. Would you like to add one of these to your itinerary?
You:[message] Yes, that sounds great. Let's add Mad Seoul to the itinerary since it has outdoor seating.
Agent: [message] I found several parks and landmarks close to the other locations. However, none of them are particularly good for groups. Would you like to add one of these to your itinerary, or should I look for other options?
You:[message] Let's add a park or landmark that has a good view of the city. It doesn't have to be good for groups.
Agent: [message] I found two places with city views. Riverside Trail is a park with a viewpoint and a high rating, but it's a bit further away. The Tower is a landmark with a viewpoint and is closer, but it has a lower rating. Which one would you prefer?
