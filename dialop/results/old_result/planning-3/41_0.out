USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]

==================== Final user Prompt ====================

>You are traveling to a new city and consulting a travel agent. For each city, you have created a document listing things you would like to do and preferences about the places you visit. The preferences are not shared between cities. Communicate with the travel agent to find the best destinations to go to for the day.

Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the itinerary you agreed on matches your preferences. You should not list all your preferences up front in the conversation.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
