USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to visit classic touristy spots. We're also looking for places with outdoor seating and takeout options from Ethiopian, Spanish, or Thai restaurants. We'd prefer to avoid live music venues as they can be too loud. We'll need a place with wifi at some point to do some work. We're renting a car, so parking would be great. Our budget is $90.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject]
