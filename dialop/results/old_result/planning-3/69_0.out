USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have made a proposal. Please let me know what you think of it.
You: [message] It's not bad so far, I'd really like to stop by Mad Seoul though.
Agent: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
You: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
Agent: [message] I have one option for you that you might be interested in. However, it is not recommended for kids. Are there any other places?
You: [message] Somewhere with a panoramic view of the city would be nice or somewhere that's kid-friendly in general.
Agent: [message] I have several options available. Do you have a price point?
You: [message] As long as it's $30 or under, it should be fine.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.
You: [accept]

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
generally like eating vegetarian options
family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids
find a place with wifi to do some work at some point
would be great if everything is reservable in advance
heard good things about City Museum of Art
prefer places rated above 3 stars
go to at least one museum
keep budget below $40
renting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'd like to visit the City Museum of Art and at least one other museum. I'd also like to find a place with wifi where I can do some work. I prefer places that are good for kids, have a rating above 3 stars, and have parking. Outdoor seating would be best. My budget is $40.
Agent: [message] I found a museum that has parking and a rating above 3 stars, but it's not recommended for kids. Would you like to consider it?
You:[message] I'd prefer to stick to places that are kid-friendly.
Agent: [message] I found two museums that are kid-friendly. One of them is the City Museum of Art that you mentioned earlier. The other one is BAMPFA, which also has parking. Would you like to consider these?
You:[message] Yes, those sound great. I'd also like to find a place with wifi where I can do some work.
Agent: [message] I found a place called Asha Tea House. It's kid-friendly and has parking, but unfortunately it doesn't have wifi. Would you like to consider it?
You:[message] I really need a place with wifi to do some work. Can you find another place that has wifi?
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but it seems that there are no places with wifi that are also kid-friendly and have parking. Would you like to consider Asha Tea House, which has parking but is not recommended for kids?
You:[message] I see. In that case, I'll have to prioritize the wifi. Please find a place that has wifi, even if it's not kid-friendly.
