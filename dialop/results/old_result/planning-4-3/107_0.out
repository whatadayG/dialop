USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You:[message] I'd like to visit Liberty Memorial and maybe a shop. I'd prefer places that are good for groups, have outdoor seating and are not too touristy. I'd like to eat at Ethiopian restaurants with vegetarian or vegan options. My budget is $60.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any Ethiopian restaurants that match your preferences. Would you like to try another type of cuisine or should I search for a shop next?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] That's okay, let's try to find a shop next.
Agent: [message] I found a few shops that might interest you, but they are a bit over your budget. Would you like to increase your budget or should I look for other options?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
