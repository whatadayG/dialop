USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
would love to see some panoramic views of the city
don't like: american, thai, ethiopian, japanese, korean, spanish, kosher, like: french, chinese, seafood
family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids
would be great if everything is reservable in advance
hidden spots much better than tourist traps
find a place with wifi to do some work at some point
no live music places, generally too loud
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
prefer just eating takeout
prefer places rated above 3 stars
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we're looking for places that are good for groups. We'd like to see some panoramic views of the city and prefer to eat takeout from French, Chinese, or seafood restaurants. We're not interested in live music and would prefer hidden spots over tourist traps. We also need a place with wifi to do some work. We'd like to keep travel distance to a minimum and prefer places rated above 3 stars.
Agent: [message] I found a couple of restaurants that might suit your preferences. The Dockside Grill is a seafood restaurant, but it doesn't have takeout. Mad Seoul is a hipster restaurant with takeout, but it's not French, Chinese, or seafood. Would you like me to look for more options or would you like to choose one of these?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with Mad Seoul for now. We also need a place with a panoramic view of the city and a place with wifi where we can do some work.
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any places that are good for groups, have wifi, and a panoramic view. However, I can suggest a place with a panoramic view and another place with wifi. Would that be acceptable?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, that would be fine. Please make sure that both places are good for groups.
Agent: [message] I found a few places that are good for groups. The Arboretum has a panoramic view of the city, but it doesn't have wifi. Would you like me to look for a place with wifi that's also good for groups?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Yes, please find a place with wifi that's also good for groups.
Agent: [message] I found a place called Asha Tea House that is good for groups and has wifi. Would you like me to include this in your itinerary?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
