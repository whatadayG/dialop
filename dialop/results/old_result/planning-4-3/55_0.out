USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we're looking for places that are good for groups and kids. We'd like to visit a shop and a museum, specifically BAMPFA or the Historical Society. We're also interested in places with outdoor seating and parking. We're not interested in live music and we don't like French or Japanese food, but we do like seafood.
