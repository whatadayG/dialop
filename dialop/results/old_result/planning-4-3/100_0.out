USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have made a proposal. Please let me know what you think of it.
You: [message] It's not bad so far, I'd really like to stop by Mad Seoul though.
Agent: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
You: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
Agent: [message] I have one option for you that you might be interested in. However, it is not recommended for kids. Are there any other places?
You: [message] Somewhere with a panoramic view of the city would be nice or somewhere that's kid-friendly in general.
Agent: [message] I have several options available. Do you have a price point?
You: [message] As long as it's $30 or under, it should be fine.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

CITY 2.
Travel Preferences:
COVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best
would love to see some panoramic views of the city
family trip, best to go to places that are good for kids
go to at least one bar
keep budget below $70
group of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups
no live music places, generally too loud
seeing hidden, non-touristy spots would be cool
generally like eating vegan options
like: ethiopian, seafood
minimize travel distance
You:[message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we're looking for places that are good for groups and kid-friendly. We'd like to see some panoramic views of the city and visit at least one bar. We prefer places with outdoor seating and vegan options, especially Ethiopian or seafood. We'd also like to see some hidden, non-touristy spots. Our budget is $70 and we'd like to minimize travel distance.
Agent: [message] I have found a few places that meet most of your preferences. However, it seems there are no Ethiopian or seafood restaurants that are good for groups and kid-friendly. Also, there are no bars that are both good for groups and kid-friendly. Would you like to adjust any of your preferences?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] That's okay, we can skip the Ethiopian and seafood restaurants. As for the bar, as long as it's not too loud or rowdy, it should be fine for the kids.
