USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the café of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

You:[message] I'd like to see some live music, eat at Ethiopian or Korean restaurants, and visit Liberty Memorial. Vegan options are a plus. I'd also like places with parking, and at least one park. My budget is $90.
Agent: [message] I found two restaurants that meet your criteria. Mad Seoul is a Korean restaurant with vegan options and parking, and it's within your budget. Earthbar is an Ethiopian restaurant with vegan options and parking, but it's slightly over your budget. Which one do you prefer?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with Mad Seoul. I'd also like to visit a park and see some live music.
Agent: [message] I found several parks near Mad Seoul. Moabit Garden is a quiet park with parking and it's open late. The Arboretum and Riverside Trail both offer viewpoints. Which one do you prefer?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with Moabit Garden. It sounds like a nice place to relax. Now, about the live music, do you have any suggestions?
Agent: [message] I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any live music events within your budget that are close to Mad Seoul and Moabit Garden. Would you like to increase your budget or consider other types of events?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] That's alright, let's stick to the budget. How about a museum or a historical site instead?
Agent: [message] I found three museums that are within your budget. The City Museum of Art is free and open late, but it doesn't have parking. BAMPFA is also open late and good for groups, but it's at the top of your budget. The Historical Society is good for kids and groups, but it's not open late. Which one do you prefer?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] Let's go with the Historical Society. It sounds like a good fit for a family trip.
