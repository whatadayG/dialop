USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'm looking for trendy places with panoramic views of the city. I prefer takeout, especially vegan options, and places with ratings above 4.5.

You:[message] I'm looking for trendy places with panoramic views of the city. I prefer takeout, especially vegan options, and places with ratings above 4.5. It's a family trip, so kid-friendly places are a must. I'll be renting a car, so parking is needed, but street parking is also okay. I prefer hidden spots over tourist traps.
