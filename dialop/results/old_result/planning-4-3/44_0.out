USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to visit places that are good for groups and kids. We've heard good things about The Mall and would like to check it out. We'd also like to go to at least one cafe and see some live music. We prefer eating takeout and vegetarian options. We'd like to see some hidden, non-touristy spots and keep our budget below $60.

User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
You: [think] Concert is not a category I can search by. I should look for a restaurant that is close to Mad Seoul and satisfies the user's preferences as much as possible.

You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]

USER 2.

User: [message] I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to visit places that are good for groups and kids. We've heard good things about The Mall and would like to check it out. We'd also like to go to at least one cafe and see some live music. We prefer eating takeout and vegetarian options. We'd like to see some hidden, non-touristy spots and keep our budget below $60. It would be great if everything is reservable in advance and the travel distance is minimized.
You:[think] The user has a lot of preferences. I will start by searching for places that are good for groups and kids, and then narrow down the options based on the other preferences.

==================== Final user Prompt ====================

>You are traveling to a new city and consulting a travel agent. For each city, you have created a document listing things you would like to do and preferences about the places you visit. The preferences are not shared between cities. Communicate with the travel agent to find the best destinations to go to for the day.

Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the itinerary you agreed on matches your preferences. You should not list all your preferences up front in the conversation.

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
