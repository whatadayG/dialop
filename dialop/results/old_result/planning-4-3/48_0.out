USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

Agent: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
You: [think] I am losing the most points from the travel time between events. I should reject the proposal and tell the agent to find sites that are closer to each other.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
Agent: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
You: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.

Agent: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
You: [think] I am still losing a lot of points from the travel time between events. This seems more important to me than the other features of the sites.
You: [reject] 
You: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.

Agent: [message] Yes sir, but there are only so many options that are kid friendly near the caf√© of your choice. However I have one more proposal that is within a much better distance of each other.
You: [think] All the events are very close to each other and the score is a lot better. My total score seems like it could be pretty good. I should accept this proposal.

You:[message] I'd like to go to Bards n Brews and some places with good views of the city. I'm traveling with a group of 7 and we'd like to go to places that are good for groups and kids. We prefer places with a casual atmosphere and ratings above 4. We're also COVID conscious, so outdoor seating would be best. We'd like to go to at least one bar that serves beer, but we're not fans of cocktails or wine.
Agent: [message] I have found several places that meet your preferences. Harper and Rye is a bar that serves beer and is close to Bards n Brews. For a place with a good view of the city, outdoor seating, and a casual atmosphere, Lucia's is a good option. It's also good for groups and kids. Lastly, Atlas Park is a casual place with a good rating that's also good for groups and kids. How does this sound?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[message] That sounds good, but I'd like to minimize travel distance as much as possible. Can you find places that are closer to each other?
Agent: [message] I have found two places that are close to Bards n Brews and meet most of your preferences. Atlas Park is a casual place with a good rating that's good for groups.
