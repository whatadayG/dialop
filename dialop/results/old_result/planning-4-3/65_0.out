USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.

You:[message] I'd really like to stick to kosher or Chinese restaurants. The City Museum of Art is a must-visit for me. As for the other places, as long as they're touristy and have parking, they should be fine.
Agent: [message] I have found some kosher or Chinese restaurants that are good for groups, such as Earthbar and Mad Seoul. For touristy spots with parking, there are many options including The Mall, Atlas Park, Garden of Wonders, The Arboretum, City Museum of Art, Hindenberg Memorial, Vista Ridge Mall, Central Plaza, and Moabit Garden. Would you like to consider these options?You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect

Agent: [message] I have proposed an itinerary that includes the City Museum of Art, Hindenberg Memorial, and Mad Seoul. These places are all touristy, have parking, and the restaurant is good for groups. Please let me know what you think.You want to accept a proposal even when it's not perfect
You:[think] The travel distance between the places is quite large, which is causing a significant loss in points. However, the places themselves are scoring well and the overall score is positive. I should accept this proposal.
