USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?

User: [message] I'd like to visit some classic tourist spots, preferably with good views of the city. I've heard Moabit Garden and The Arboretum are good parks to visit. I'd also like to find a place with wifi where I can do some work. I'm traveling with a group of 7, so places that are good for groups would be ideal. We prefer Thai, French, American, Spanish, and Chinese food, but not Korean. We also like wine, but not beer or cocktails. My budget is $90.
