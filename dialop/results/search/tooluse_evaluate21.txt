To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, has parking, wifi], filters=[category == museum], sort_by=[price])`
   - Result: 
     - BAMPFA: museum, good for kids: False, has parking: True
     - Historical Society: museum, good for kids: False, has parking: True
     - City Museum of Art: museum, good for kids: True, has parking: True
   - Analysis: The query correctly filters for museums and returns the correct fields. The dataset does not provide information on wifi, which is noted as "Not Available." This query is correct.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, has parking, wifi], text_query="panoramic view", sort_by=[price])`
   - Result:
     - Riverside Trail: park, good for kids: False, has parking: True
     - The Arboretum: park, good for kids: False, has parking: True
   - Analysis: The query uses a text query for "panoramic view." The dataset does not explicitly mention "panoramic view," but both results are parks with viewpoints, which could imply a panoramic view. The query is correct based on the available data.

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, has parking, wifi], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query="vegetarian Korean", sort_by=[price])`
   - Result:
     - Saul's: restaurant, good for kids: True, has parking: True
   - Analysis: The query filters for restaurants and searches for "vegetarian Korean." Saul's is a Korean restaurant, but the dataset does not specify vegetarian options for Saul's. This query is incorrect because it assumes vegetarian options without explicit data.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Third query)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (First and second queries)

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 3, 1, 2.
