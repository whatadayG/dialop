To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], text_query="The Tower Einstein's summer house")`
   - This query is correct. It searches for specific landmarks by name.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == museum], sort_by=[distance_to(The Tower)])`
   - This query is correct. It filters for museums and sorts by distance to "The Tower".

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == restaurant, info == Chinese], sort_by=[distance_to(The Tower)])`
   - This query is incorrect. There is no "Chinese" information in the dataset, leading to no results.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == restaurant, info == takeout, info == vegetarian], sort_by=[distance_to(The Tower)])`
   - This query is correct. It filters for restaurants with takeout and vegetarian options.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name], sort_by=[distance_to(The Tower)], limit=3)`
   - This query is correct. It sorts by distance to "The Tower" and limits the results to 3.

Now, let's summarize the results:

- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 3)
- Number of correct queries: 4

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 5, 1, 4
