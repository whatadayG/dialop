To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == French, info == takeout, rating > 4], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is incorrect because there are no restaurants with French cuisine, takeout, and a rating greater than 4 in the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == French, info == takeout], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is incorrect because there are no restaurants with French cuisine and takeout in the dataset.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == French], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is incorrect because there are no restaurants with French cuisine in the dataset.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == takeout, rating > 4], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is incorrect because there are no restaurants with takeout and a rating greater than 4 in the dataset.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == takeout], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is incorrect because the result shows "The Cakery" with "has takeout: False", indicating no restaurant with takeout.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == bar, rating > 4], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is correct because "The Dive" is a bar with a rating of 4, which matches the filter criteria.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, info, price], filters=[category == cafe, info == wifi], sort_by=[price])`
   - This query is correct because "Coffee Nook" is a cafe with wifi, matching the filter criteria.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name], sort_by=[distance_to(Garden of Wonders)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct as it returns the two closest places to "Garden of Wonders", which are "Garden of Wonders" itself and "Kozy Kar".

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 8
- Number of incorrect queries: 5 (Queries 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Queries 6, 7, 8)

[result]:: 8, 5, 3
