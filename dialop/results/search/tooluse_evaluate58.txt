2. **Query 2:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, info]`, `filters=[category == restaurant]`, `text_query=Chinese food, vegan options`
   - **Result:** No results
   - **Analysis:** The dataset does not contain any restaurant with Chinese food and vegan options. Therefore, this query is correct.

   - **Result:** 5 results
   - **Analysis:** The query is looking for restaurants with vegan options. The results include The Dockside Grill, Lucia's, Saul's, and others, which match the criteria. Therefore, this query is correct.

4. **Query 4:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, info]`, `text_query=panoramic view`
   - **Result:** No results
   - **Analysis:** The dataset does not contain any entries with a panoramic view. Therefore, this query is correct.

5. **Query 5:**

   - **Analysis:** The query is looking for places that are good for kids and not too serious. The results include The Arboretum, Central Plaza, Market Street, The Mall, and Lincoln Park, which match the criteria. Therefore, this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
