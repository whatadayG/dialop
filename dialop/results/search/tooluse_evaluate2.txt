To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=park has parking)`
   - This query searches for names with the text "park has parking". The results are "Hindenberg Memorial", "Garden of Wonders", and "The Arboretum". However, "Hindenberg Memorial" is a landmark, not a park. The other two are parks. The query is partially correct but not entirely accurate due to the inclusion of a non-park result.
   - **Incorrect**.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == park], text_query=live music)`
   - This query searches for parks with "live music". The dataset shows no parks with live music, and the search correctly returns no results.
   - **Correct**.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query=vegetarian options live music)`
   - This query searches for restaurants with "vegetarian options" and "live music". The results are "Cookies Cream" and "Mad Seoul". "Cookies Cream" has live music but no mention of vegetarian options, and "Mad Seoul" has vegetarian options but no live music. The query is incorrect as neither result fully matches both criteria.
   - **Incorrect**.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=2)`
   - This query sorts by distance to "Bards n Brews" and limits the results to 2. The results are "City Museum of Art" and "The Cakery", both 0.1 distance away. This query is correct as it correctly identifies the closest locations.
   - **Correct**.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name], filters=[category == park], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=1)`
   - This query filters for parks and sorts by distance to "Bards n Brews", limiting to 1 result. The result is "Lincoln Park" at 0.3 distance, which is correct based on the dataset.
   - **Correct**.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 2 (Queries 1 and 3)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Queries 2, 4, and 5)

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 5, 2, 3
