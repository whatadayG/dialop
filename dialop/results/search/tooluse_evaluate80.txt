   - Text query: "Korean, Chinese, Japanese, seafood, Thai, Spanish, kosher"
   - Results: The Dockside Grill (Chinese, vegetarian options), The Cakery (Thai, outdoor seating)
   - **Correct**: The Dockside Grill matches the filters and text query. The Cakery matches the filters but has a rating of 1, which is not specified in the query, so it's not incorrect.

   - Results: The Arboretum (non-touristy), Caribbean Corner (non-touristy)
   - **Correct**: Both results match the text query for non-touristy.

4. **Query 4**: 
   - Filters: category == restaurant, info == outdoor seating, info == vegetarian options, rating >= 4
   - Text query: "Korean, Chinese, Japanese, seafood, Thai, Spanish, kosher"
   - Results: The Dockside Grill (Chinese, vegetarian options)

5. **Query 5**: 
   - Filters: category == museum, rating >= 4
   - Results: City Museum of Art, Historical Society
   - **Correct**: Both results are museums with a rating >= 4.

6. **Query 6**:
