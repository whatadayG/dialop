To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == rated above 3 stars, info == has parking, info == good for kids, info == outdoor seating], sort_by=[distance_to(Taqueria y Mas, The Dockside Grill)], limit=1)`
   - **Expected Result:** A restaurant that is rated above 3 stars, has parking, is good for kids, and has outdoor seating.
   - **Dataset Check:** 
     - "The Dockside Grill" is rated above 3 stars, has parking, but does not mention being good for kids or having outdoor seating.
     - "El Toro Steakhouse" is rated 3 stars, has parking, but does not mention being good for kids or having outdoor seating.
   - **Conclusion:** No restaurant in the dataset meets all the criteria. Therefore, the query result is incorrect.

2. **Second Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == rated above 3 stars, info == has parking, info == good for kids, info == outdoor seating], sort_by=[distance_to(Taqueria y Mas, The Dockside Grill)], limit=1)`
   - **Expected Result:** Same criteria as the first query.
   - **Dataset Check:** 
     - The same analysis applies as the first query.
   - **Conclusion:** The query result is incorrect.

**Summary:**
- Total number of queries: 2
- Number of incorrect queries: 2
- Number of correct queries: 0

[result]:: 2, 2, 0
