To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], filters=[category == landmark, has parking == True, outdoor seating == True])`
   - Incorrect: There are no landmarks with outdoor seating in the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], filters=[category == landmark, has parking == True])`
   - Correct: Returns three landmarks with parking.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name], filters=[outdoor seating == True])`
   - Correct: Returns four places with outdoor seating.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, rating, info], filters=[category == restaurant, rating > 4.5, touristy == False])`
   - Incorrect: No restaurants have a rating greater than 4.5.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, rating, info], filters=[category == restaurant, rating > 4.5])`
   - Incorrect: No restaurants have a rating greater than 4.5.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, rating, info], filters=[category == restaurant, rating > 4])`
   - Correct: Returns one restaurant with a rating greater than 4.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name], filters=[category == landmark, has parking == True], sort_by=[distance_to(Schwarzes Cafe, Asha Tea House)], limit=1)`
   - Correct: Returns the closest landmark with parking to the specified cafes.

Now, let's count the queries:
- Total number of queries: 7
- Number of incorrect queries: 2 (Queries 1, 4, and 5)
- Number of correct queries: 5 (Queries 2, 3, 6, and 7)

[result]:: 7, 2, 5
