To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, price, info]`
   - **Filters:** `[category == restaurant, info == Spanish, info == vegan options, info == good for groups, info == has parking]`
   - **Sort by:** `[rating]`
   - **Limit:** `3`
   - **Result:** `Cookies Cream` is returned, but it does not have "vegan options" or "has parking". This query is incorrect.

2. **Query 2:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, info]`
   - **Filters:** `[category == landmark, info == non-touristy, info == good for groups, info == has parking]`
   - **Sort by:** `[rating]`
   - **Limit:** `3`
   - **Result:** `Liberty Memorial`, `Hindenberg Memorial`, and `The Tower` are returned. All match the filters. This query is correct.

3. **Query 3:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, info]`
   - **Filters:** `[info == non-touristy, info == good for groups, info == has parking]`
   - **Sort by:** `[rating]`
   - **Limit:** `3`
   - **Result:** `Hindenberg Memorial`, `Liberty Memorial`, and `The Tower` are returned. All match the filters. This query is correct.

4. **Query 4:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, info]`
   - **Filters:** `[info == good for groups, info == has parking]`
   - **Sort by:** `[distance_to(Cookies Cream, Liberty Memorial, The Tower)]`
   - **Limit:** `3`
   - **Result:** `The Tower`, `Liberty Memorial`, and `Mad Seoul` are returned. All match the filters. This query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 1)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Queries 2, 3, and 4)

Therefore, the result is: 

[result]:: 4, 1, 3
