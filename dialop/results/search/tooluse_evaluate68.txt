To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == museum], text_query="City Museum of Art OR BAMPFA")`
   - This query is correct as it returns results for the specified museums.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == museum, rating > 4.5])`
   - This query is correct as it returns no results, which is expected since no museum has a rating above 4.5.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == cafe, rating > 4.5], text_query="wifi")`
   - This query is correct as it returns no results, which is expected since no cafe has a rating above 4.5.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == park, rating > 4.5], text_query="panoramic views")`
   - This query is correct as it returns no results, which is expected since no park has a rating above 4.5 or mentions panoramic views.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == shop, rating > 4.5], text_query="hidden spots")`
   - This query is correct as it returns no results, which is expected since no shop has a rating above 4.5 or mentions hidden spots.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == shop], text_query="hidden spots", sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)], limit=1)`
   - This query is correct as it returns the closest shop to BAMPFA, even though it doesn't mention hidden spots.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == cafe], text_query="wifi", sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)], limit=1)`
   - This query is correct as it returns the closest cafe to BAMPFA that mentions wifi.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == park], text_query="panoramic views", sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)], limit=1)`
   - This query is correct as it returns the closest park to BAMPFA, even though it doesn't mention panoramic views.

In summary, all queries are correct. Therefore, the total number of queries is 8, with 0 incorrect queries and 8 correct queries.
