To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze the provided dataset and the search query:

1. **Total Number of Queries**: 
   - There is only one query present in the provided text, which is: 
     ```
     You:[tool] Search(fields=[name, category, has parking], filters=[category == shop], sort_by=[distance_to(Schwarzes Cafe)])
     ```

2. **Correctness of the Query**:
   - The query is searching for shops and sorting them by distance to "Schwarzes Cafe".
   - The dataset contains the following shops:
     - Artisan Street Fair (has parking: False)
     - The Mall (has parking: False)
     - Central Plaza (has parking: True)
     - Market Street (has parking: True)
     - Vista Ridge Mall (has parking: True)
   - The query results match the dataset in terms of the category (shop) and the "has parking" attribute.
   - The query results are sorted by distance to "Schwarzes Cafe", which is located at [-122.3, 37.88]. The dataset does not provide explicit distances, but the results seem to be sorted correctly based on the assumption of proximity.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The query is correct as it accurately reflects the dataset and the specified conditions.

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 1, 0, 1
