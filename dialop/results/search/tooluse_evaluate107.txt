3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=wine)`
   - Correct: It searches for names with "wine" in the dataset.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == bar], text_query=wine)`
   - Correct: It searches for bars with "wine" in the info.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == bar], text_query=outdoor seating)`
   - Correct: It searches for bars with "outdoor seating" in the info.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[name in [Schwarzes Cafe, Historical Society, Bards n Brews]])`
   - Correct: It searches for the price of specific names.

   - Correct: It sorts by distance to "Historical Society" and limits to 3 results.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[price <= 50], sort_by=[distance_to(Historical Society)], limit=3)`
   - Correct: It filters by price, sorts by distance to "Historical Society", and limits to 3 results.

9. **Query 9**: `Search(fields=[name, price, category, info], filters=[category == bar, price <= 50], sort_by=[distance_to(Historical Society)], limit=1)`
   - Incorrect: The result shows a bar with a price of 60, which is above the filter of 50.

10. **Query 10**: `Search(fields=[name, price, category, info], filters=[category == bar, price <= 50], sort_by=[distance_to(Historical Society)], limit=3)`
    - Incorrect: The result includes bars with prices above 50, which violates the filter condition.

11. **Query 11**: `Search(fields=[name, price, category, info], filters=[category == bar, price <= 50], sort_by=[price], limit=1)`
    - Incorrect: The result shows a bar with a price of 60, which is above the filter of 50.

12. **Query 12**: `Search(fields=[name, price, category, info], filters=[category == bar], sort_by=[price], limit=1)`
    - Correct: It sorts bars by price and limits to 1 result.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 12
- Number of incorrect queries: 3 (Queries 9, 10, and 11)
- Number of correct queries: 9

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 12, 3, 9.
