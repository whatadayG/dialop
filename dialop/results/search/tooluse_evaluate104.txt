To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, has wifi], filters=[category == shop])`
   - The query is asking for shops and their fields: name, category, good for kids, and has wifi.
   - The dataset contains shops, but none of the shops have the "has wifi" field available.
   - The query result is correct because it returns the available fields for shops, even though "has wifi" is not available for any shop.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, has wifi, info], filters=[category == restaurant, info contains vegetarian], sort_by=[price], limit=3)`
   - The query is asking for restaurants with vegetarian options, sorted by price, and limited to 3 results.
   - The dataset contains restaurants with vegetarian options, but the field "info" is not explicitly available in the dataset. However, the query result seems to interpret the presence of vegetarian options as part of the "info".
   - The query result is correct because it returns restaurants with vegetarian options, sorted by price, and limited to 3 results.

Based on the analysis:
- Total number of queries: 2
- Number of incorrect queries: 0
- Number of correct queries: 2

[result]:: 2, 0, 2
