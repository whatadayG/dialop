To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query="Ethiopian OR Korean")`
   - This query is looking for restaurants with either Ethiopian or Korean in their text. There are no such entries in the dataset.
   - **Result**: Correct query (no results found as expected).

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query="takeout AND outdoor seating")`
   - This query is looking for restaurants with both takeout and outdoor seating. The dataset shows "Earthbar" matches this criteria.
   - **Result**: Correct query (found "Earthbar" as expected).

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == park])`
   - This query is looking for all parks. The dataset contains several parks.
   - **Result**: Correct query (found all parks as expected).

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info, rating], filters=[category == restaurant, rating > 4], text_query="takeout AND outdoor seating")`
   - This query is looking for restaurants with a rating greater than 4 and both takeout and outdoor seating. There are no such entries in the dataset.
   - **Result**: Correct query (no results found as expected).

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == park, viewpoint == True])`
   - This query is looking for parks with a viewpoint. The dataset shows no parks with a viewpoint.
   - **Result**: Correct query (no results found as expected).

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, category, rating], filters=[category == park], sort_by=[rating], limit=3)`
   - This query is looking for the top 3 parks sorted by rating. The dataset shows "The Arboretum", "Moabit Garden", and "Garden of Wonders" as the top 3.
   - **Result**: Correct query (found top 3 parks as expected).

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 6
- Number of incorrect queries: 0
- Number of correct queries: 6

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 6, 0, 6.
