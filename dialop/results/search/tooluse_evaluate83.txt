To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1:**
   - `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, outdoor seating, vegan options], filters=[category == shop OR category == bar], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for entries in the categories "shop" or "bar" with the text query "good for groups". The results match the dataset.

2. **Query 2:**
   - `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, outdoor seating, vegan options], filters=[category == shop], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is incorrect. The dataset shows that there are shops with "good for groups" as true, but the search returned no results.

3. **Query 3:**
   - `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, outdoor seating, vegan options, rating], filters=[rating > 4], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for entries with a rating greater than 4 and the text query "good for groups". The results match the dataset.

4. **Query 4:**
   - `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, local beers], filters=[category == bar], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is incorrect. The search includes "local beers" which is not a field in the dataset, and the results are inconsistent with the dataset.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 2 (Query 2 and Query 4)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (Query 1 and Query 3)

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 4, 2, 2
