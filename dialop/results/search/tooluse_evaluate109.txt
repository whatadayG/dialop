To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze the provided dataset and the search queries:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups], filters=[category == cafe], text_query=live music)`
   - Result: "No results"
   - Analysis: The query is searching for cafes with "live music". In the dataset, there are no cafes with the feature "live music". Therefore, this query is correct.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups], text_query=live music)`
   - Result: 5 results, all of which are restaurants with "live music".
   - Analysis: The query is searching for any category with "live music". The results correctly show restaurants with "live music". Therefore, this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Total number of queries: 2
- Number of incorrect queries: 0
- Number of correct queries: 2

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 2, 0, 2.
