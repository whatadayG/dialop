To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query one by one:

1. **Query 1:** `Search(fields=[name], text_query=hidden spots good for kids outdoor seating)`
   - The dataset contains two entries with "good for kids" and "outdoor seating": "Taqueria y Mas" and "The Dockside Grill".
   - This query is correct.

2. **Query 2:** `Search(fields=[name], text_query=live music city view)`
   - The dataset contains two entries with "live music": "Harper and Rye" and "Bards n Brews".
   - The query does not specify "city view" as a feature in the dataset, but the results are consistent with the "live music" feature.
   - This query is correct.

3. **Query 3:** `Search(fields=[name, good for kids, outdoor seating], filters=[name == "City Museum of Art" OR name == "BAMPFA"])`
   - The dataset shows that neither "City Museum of Art" nor "BAMPFA" has "good for kids" or "outdoor seating".
   - This query is correct.

4. **Query 4:** `Search(fields=[name], text_query=parking COVID conscious)`
   - The dataset contains entries with "has parking": "The Dive", "The Cakery", "Riverside Trail", "BAMPFA", "Asha Tea House", "Einstein's summer house", "Lincoln Park", "Market Street", "Artisan Street Fair", and "Vista Ridge Mall".
   - The query does not specify "COVID conscious" as a feature in the dataset, but the results are consistent with the "has parking" feature.
   - This query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:

- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 0
- Number of correct queries: 4

[result]:: 4, 0, 4
