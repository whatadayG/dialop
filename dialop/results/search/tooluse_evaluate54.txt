To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == bar], text_query="cocktails outdoor seating")`
   - Result: 
     - A-Trane: Matches the text query "cocktails" but does not have "outdoor seating".
     - The Jazz Spot: Matches "outdoor seating" but not "cocktails".
   - Conclusion: The query is incorrect because neither result fully matches both "cocktails" and "outdoor seating".

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category != bar, touristy == False], text_query="good city views good for groups", sort_by=[distance_to(Market Street)])`
   - Result:
     - The Arboretum: Is touristy, so it should not be included.
     - Riverside Trail: Matches the criteria.
     - Artisan Street Fair: Is a shop, so it should not be included.
   - Conclusion: The query is incorrect because The Arboretum is touristy and Artisan Street Fair is a shop, both of which should not be included.

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category != bar, category != shop, touristy == False], text_query="good city views good for groups", sort_by=[distance_to(Market Street)])`
   - Result:
     - Garden of Wonders: Matches the criteria.
     - Riverside Trail: Matches the criteria.
     - The Arboretum: Is touristy, so it should not be included.
   - Conclusion: The query is incorrect because The Arboretum is touristy and should not be included.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 3
- Number of correct queries: 0

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 3, 3, 0
