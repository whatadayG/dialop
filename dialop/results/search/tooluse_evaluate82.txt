To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=good for groups and kids)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for places that are good for groups and kids, and the results match the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=outdoor seating and parking)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for places with outdoor seating and parking, and the results match the dataset.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=reservable in advance)`
   - This query is incorrect. The dataset does not have a feature explicitly labeled as "reservable in advance," so no results are returned.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating], filters=[good for kids, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating], sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)])`
   - This query is correct. It filters for places that are good for kids, good for groups, have parking, and have outdoor seating, and sorts by distance to BAMPFA. The results match the dataset.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating], filters=[category == shop, good for kids, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating], sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for shops that are good for kids, good for groups, have parking, and have outdoor seating. No results are returned, which is correct as per the dataset.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for kids, good for groups], filters=[category == shop, good for kids, good for groups], sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for shops that are good for kids and good for groups, and the results match the dataset.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 6
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 3)
- Number of correct queries: 5

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 6, 1, 5.
