To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, good for kids, good for groups], filters=[category == landmark, rating > 3, good for kids == True, good for groups == True])`
   - **Expected Result:** A landmark with a rating greater than 3, good for kids, and good for groups.
   - **Dataset Check:** The Tower is the only landmark that matches all these criteria.
   - **Result:** Correct.

2. **Second Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, good for kids, good for groups], filters=[touristy == False, rating > 3, good for kids == True, good for groups == True])`
   - **Expected Result:** Non-touristy places with a rating greater than 3, good for kids, and good for groups.
   - **Dataset Check:** Vista Ridge Mall and Atlas Park match these criteria.
   - **Result:** Correct.

3. **Third Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, good for kids, good for groups], filters=[rating > 3, good for kids == True, good for groups == True], sort_by=[distance_to(BAMPFA)])`
   - **Expected Result:** Places with a rating greater than 3, good for kids, and good for groups, sorted by distance to BAMPFA.
   - **Dataset Check:** Atlas Park, Vista Ridge Mall, and The Mall match these criteria. The sorting by distance to BAMPFA is correct based on their locations.
   - **Result:** Correct.

**Summary:**
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 0

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 3, 0, 3.
