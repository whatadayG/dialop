To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=landmark)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for landmarks by name, and the results match the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=has wifi)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for places with "has wifi" in their features, and the results match the dataset.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, price], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct. It sorts by distance to "Bards n Brews" and limits the results to 2. The results are consistent with the dataset.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, price], sort_by=[distance_to(The Jazz Spot)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct. It sorts by distance to "The Jazz Spot" and limits the results to 2. The results are consistent with the dataset.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[price <= 30], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct. It filters by price <= 30, sorts by distance to "Bards n Brews," and limits the results to 2. The results are consistent with the dataset.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[price <= 30], sort_by=[distance_to(The Jazz Spot)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct. It filters by price <= 30, sorts by distance to "The Jazz Spot," and limits the results to 2. The results are consistent with the dataset.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[category == landmark, price <= 30], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=1)`
   - This query is incorrect. The filter `category == landmark` is not valid as the correct filter should be `etype == landmark`. Therefore, this query is incorrect.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[price <= 30], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct. It filters by price <= 30, sorts by distance to "Bards n Brews," and limits the results to 2. The results are consistent with the dataset.

9. **Query 9**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[price <= 30], sort_by=[distance_to(The Jazz Spot)], limit=2)`
   - This query is correct. It filters by price <= 30, sorts by distance to "The Jazz Spot," and limits the results to 2. The results are consistent with the dataset.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 9
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 7)
- Number of correct queries: 8

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 9, 1, 8
