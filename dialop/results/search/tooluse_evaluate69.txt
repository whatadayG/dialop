To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == park, info == has parking])`
   - This query is asking for parks that have parking. The dataset shows six parks with parking: The Arboretum, Moabit Garden, Atlas Park, Riverside Trail, Garden of Wonders, and Lincoln Park.
   - Result: Correct

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, distance_to(Caribbean Corner)], filters=[category == park, info == has parking], sort_by=[distance_to(Caribbean Corner)], limit=1)`
   - This query is asking for the nearest park with parking to Caribbean Corner. The dataset shows The Arboretum as the closest park with parking to Caribbean Corner.
   - Result: Correct

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, info, distance_to(Caribbean Corner)], filters=[info == outdoor seating, info == vegetarian OR vegan], sort_by=[distance_to(Caribbean Corner)], limit=1)`
   - This query is asking for the nearest place with outdoor seating and either vegetarian or vegan options to Caribbean Corner. The dataset shows Common Grounds as having outdoor seating and vegetarian options, and it is 1.1 units away from Caribbean Corner.
   - Result: Correct

Now, let's summarize the results:

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 3, 0, 3.
