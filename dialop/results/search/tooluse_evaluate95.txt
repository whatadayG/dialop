To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly, outdoor seating, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly], text_query=Ethiopian OR seafood)`
   - Result: No results
   - This query is correct as it returns no results, which is expected given the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly, outdoor seating, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly, outdoor seating], text_query=vegan)`
   - Result: 1 result (Coffee Nook)
   - This query is correct as it returns a result that matches the filters and text query.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, outdoor seating, viewpoint], filters=[category == bar, good for groups, outdoor seating])`
   - Result: 2 results (Bards n Brews, Harper and Rye)
   - This query is correct as it returns results that match the filters.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint])`
   - Result: 1 result (The Arboretum)
   - This query is correct as it returns a result that matches the filters.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint], sort_by=[distance_to(Coffee Nook)])`
   - Result: 1 result (The Arboretum)
   - This query is correct as it returns a result that matches the filters and sorting criteria.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, outdoor seating, viewpoint], filters=[category == bar, good for groups, outdoor seating])`
   - Result: 2 results (Bards n Brews, Harper and Rye)
   - This query is correct as it returns results that match the filters.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint])`
   - Result: 1 result (The Arboretum)
   - This query is correct as it returns a result that matches the filters.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)])`
   - Result: 2 results (The Arboretum, Lincoln Park)
   - This query is incorrect because Lincoln Park does not match the filter "good for groups, kid friendly, viewpoint".

9. **Query 9**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, kid friendly], filters=[good for groups, kid friendly], sort_by=[distance_to(Bards n Brews)], limit=2)`
   - Result: 2 results (Historical Society, The Mall)
   - This query is correct as it returns results that match the filters and sorting criteria.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 9
