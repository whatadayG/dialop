To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, rating, good for kids, outdoor seating, viewpoint], filters=[rating > 4, good for kids, outdoor seating, viewpoint])`
   - Result: `The Arboretum` with a rating of 4.5, good for kids, outdoor seating, and viewpoint.
   - Verification: The Arboretum matches all the filter criteria (rating > 4, good for kids, outdoor seating, viewpoint).
   - Conclusion: Correct query.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, price, info], filters=[category == bar, price <= 70], text_query="wine beer wifi", sort_by=[distance_to(The Arboretum)])`
   - Result: `The Dive`, `A-Trane`, `The Jazz Spot`.
   - Verification: 
     - `The Dive` is a bar with a price of 60, which matches the filter criteria.
     - `A-Trane` is a bar with a price of 60, which matches the filter criteria.
     - `The Jazz Spot` is a bar with a price of 90, which does not match the price filter (price <= 70).
   - Conclusion: Incorrect query because `The Jazz Spot` does not meet the price filter.

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, price, info], filters=[price <= 70], sort_by=[distance_to(A-Trane)], limit=1)`
   - Result: `Asha Tea House` with a price of 5.
   - Verification: `Asha Tea House` has a price of 5, which matches the filter criteria (price <= 70).
   - Conclusion: Correct query.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (second query)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (first and third queries)

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 3, 1, 2
