To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=hidden spots with panoramic views and parking)`
   - The search result is "Garden of Wonders," which matches the criteria of having parking and being a hidden spot with a viewpoint.
   - **Correct Query**

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=shop)`
   - The search results include five shops, which is correct as it matches the category "shop."
   - **Correct Query**

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=outdoor seating)`
   - The search results include seven places with outdoor seating, which matches the criteria.
   - **Correct Query**

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == shop], text_query=hidden spot)`
   - The search results indicate "No results," which is correct because none of the shops are explicitly labeled as "hidden spots."
   - **Correct Query**

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == shop, info NOT LIKE %touristy%])`
   - The search results include three shops, two of which are not touristy ("Vista Ridge Mall" and "Market Street"). "Central Plaza" is touristy, so this part of the query is incorrect.
   - **Incorrect Query**

Now, let's summarize the results:

- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 5)
- Number of correct queries: 4

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 5, 1, 4
