To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query="takeout French American Thai Spanish Ethiopian Korean Kosher")`
   - The query is searching for restaurants with takeout options and specific cuisines.
   - Results:
     - El Toro Steakhouse: Matches the criteria (Thai cuisine, has takeout).
     - The Dockside Grill: Does not match (no takeout).
     - Earthbar: Matches the criteria (has takeout).
     - Cookies Cream: Does not match (Japanese cuisine, no takeout).
   - The query is partially correct because it returned some correct results but also included incorrect ones.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == cafe], text_query="outdoor seating kid-friendly")`
   - The query is searching for cafes with outdoor seating and that are kid-friendly.
   - Results:
     - Common Grounds: Matches the criteria (outdoor seating, good for kids).
     - Asha Tea House: Does not match (no outdoor seating, not specified as kid-friendly).
   - The query is partially correct because it returned one correct result but also included an incorrect one.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Total number of queries: 2
- Number of incorrect queries: 0 (since both queries returned at least one correct result, they are not entirely incorrect)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (considering partial correctness as correct for this context)

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 2, 0, 2
