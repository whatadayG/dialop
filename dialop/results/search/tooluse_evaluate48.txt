To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == good for groups, info == vegetarian options, info == takeout, info == rating > 3], sort_by=[distance_to(Harper and Rye)])`
   - **Result:** `Taqueria y Mas` is a restaurant that is good for groups, has vegetarian options, offers takeout, and has a rating of 4. The result is correct.

2. **Second Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, info, price], filters=[category == restaurant, info == good for groups, info == vegetarian options, info == takeout, info == rating > 3, price <= 70], sort_by=[distance_to(Harper and Rye)])`
   - **Result:** No results. This is correct because there are no restaurants that meet all the specified criteria (including price <= 70).

3. **Third Query:**
   - **Query:** `Search(fields=[name, category, info, price], filters=[category == shop, info == good for groups], sort_by=[distance_to(Harper and Rye)])`
   - **Result:** `Vista Ridge Mall`, `Market Street`, and `Central Plaza` are shops that are good for groups. The result is correct.

Now, let's summarize the findings:

- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 0
- Number of correct queries: 3

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 3, 0, 3
