To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == cafe, info NOT LIKE %romantic%, info LIKE %hidden%, info LIKE %non-touristy%])`
   - Result: No results
   - Analysis: The dataset contains two cafes, "Schwarzes Cafe" and "Asha Tea House," both described as hidden and non-touristy. The query should have returned these two cafes. Therefore, this query is incorrect.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == cafe, info LIKE %hidden%, info LIKE %non-touristy%])`
   - Result: Two results - "Schwarzes Cafe" and "Asha Tea House"
   - Analysis: This query correctly identifies the two cafes that match the criteria. Therefore, this query is correct.

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, has parking, good for kids], filters=[name == Schwarzes Cafe OR name == Asha Tea House])`
   - Result: Two results - "Schwarzes Cafe" (has parking: False, good for kids: True) and "Asha Tea House" (has parking: False, good for kids: False)
   - Analysis: This query correctly retrieves the parking and kid-friendly information for the specified cafes. Therefore, this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (First query)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (Second and third queries)

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 3, 1, 2.
