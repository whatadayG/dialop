To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "good for groups" and returns results that match the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=has wifi)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "has wifi" and returns results that match the dataset.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=viewpoint)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "viewpoint" and returns results that match the dataset.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query="takeout French Chinese seafood")`
   - This query is correct. It searches for restaurants with the text "takeout French Chinese seafood" and returns results that match the dataset.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, good for groups, has wifi, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups AND has wifi AND viewpoint], sort_by=[distance_to(Mad Seoul)])`
   - This query is incorrect. It searches for entries that are good for groups, have wifi, and have a viewpoint, but no such entries exist in the dataset.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, good for groups, has wifi, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups AND (has wifi OR viewpoint)], sort_by=[distance_to(Mad Seoul)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for entries that are good for groups and either have wifi or a viewpoint, and returns results that match the dataset.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, good for groups, has wifi], filters=[good for groups AND has wifi], sort_by=[distance_to(Mad Seoul)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for entries that are good for groups and have wifi, and returns results that match the dataset.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 7
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 5)
- Number of correct queries: 6

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 7, 1, 6
