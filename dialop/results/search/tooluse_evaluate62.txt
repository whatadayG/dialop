To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, price, info], filters=[category == restaurant, info == Ethiopian], sort_by=[price])`
   - The dataset does not contain any restaurant with Ethiopian cuisine. 
   - Result: No results.
   - This query is correct because it correctly returns no results based on the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == shop, good for groups, outdoor seating, not touristy], sort_by=[price])`
   - The dataset does not contain any shop that is good for groups, has outdoor seating, and is not touristy.
   - Result: No results.
   - This query is incorrect because it returned results that do not match the filter criteria.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == shop, good for groups, outdoor seating, not touristy], sort_by=[price], limit=3)`
   - Same as Query 2, the dataset does not contain any shop that is good for groups, has outdoor seating, and is not touristy.
   - Result: No results.
   - This query is incorrect because it returned results that do not match the filter criteria.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, price, info], filters=[category == restaurant, good for groups, outdoor seating, not touristy, vegetarian OR vegan], sort_by=[price])`
   - The dataset contains restaurants that match the criteria: Lucia's, Cookies Cream, and El Toro Steakhouse.
   - Result: Correct results.
   - This query is correct because it correctly returns results based on the dataset.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, price, info], filters=[category != restaurant, good for groups, outdoor seating, not touristy], sort_by=[price])`
   - The dataset contains cafes that match the criteria: The Cupcake Bar and Schwarzes Cafe.
   - Result: Correct results.
   - This query is correct because it correctly returns results based on the dataset.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 2 (Queries 2 and 3)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Queries 1, 4, and 5)

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 5, 2, 3.
