To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == cafe], text_query="wifi outdoor seating takeout")`
   - This query is correct. It searches for cafes with specific features, and the result "Asha Tea House" matches the criteria.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, info], text_query="city views")`
   - This query is incorrect. The search for "city views" returned no results, and there is no mention of "city views" in the dataset.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, info], sort_by=[distance_to(Market Street, Artisan Street Fair)], limit=3)`
   - This query is correct. It sorts by distance to "Market Street" and "Artisan Street Fair" and returns three results, which are valid entries in the dataset.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == shop, has parking == True], sort_by=[distance_to(Market Street, Artisan Street Fair)], limit=1)`
   - This query is correct. It filters for shops with parking and sorts by distance, returning "Vista Ridge Mall," which matches the criteria.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 2)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Queries 1, 3, and 4)

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 4, 1, 3
