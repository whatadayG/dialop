To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "good for groups" and returns relevant results.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=has parking)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "has parking" and returns relevant results.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, category], filters=[category == shop], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names and categories where the category is "shop" and the text "good for groups" is present, returning relevant results.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=wifi)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "wifi" and returns relevant results.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=outdoor seating)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "outdoor seating" and returns relevant results.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=takeout)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names with the text "takeout" and returns relevant results.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, price], filters=[price <= 90])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names and prices where the price is less than or equal to 90, returning relevant results.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating], filters=[good for groups AND has parking AND outdoor seating], sort_by=[distance_to(Kozy Kar)], limit=3)`
   - This query is incorrect. The results include entries that do not have all three features: "good for groups," "has parking," and "outdoor seating."

9. **Query 9**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating, wifi], filters=[good for groups AND has parking AND outdoor seating AND wifi], sort_by=[distance_to(Kozy Kar)], limit=3)`
   - This query is incorrect. The results include entries that do not have all four features: "good for groups," "has parking," "outdoor seating," and "wifi."

10. **Query 10**: `Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, has parking, outdoor seating, takeout], filters=[good for groups AND has parking AND outdoor seating AND takeout], sort_by=[distance_to(Kozy Kar)], limit=3)`
    - This query is incorrect. The results include entries that do not have all four features: "good for groups," "has parking," "outdoor seating," and "takeout."

Now, let's summarize the results:

- Total number of queries: 10
- Number of incorrect queries: 3 (Queries 8, 9, and 10)
- Number of correct queries: 7

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 10, 3, 7
