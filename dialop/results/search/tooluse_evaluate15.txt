To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `You:[tool] Search(fields=[name], text_query=good for groups)`
   - This query searches for entries with the text "good for groups" in the name field. The dataset does not have "good for groups" in any name, so this query is incorrect.

2. **Query 2**: `You:[tool] Search(fields=[name], text_query=has wifi)`
   - This query searches for entries with the text "has wifi" in the name field. The dataset does not mention "wifi" in any entry, so this query is incorrect.

3. **Query 3**: `You:[tool] Search(fields=[name], text_query=viewpoint)`
   - This query searches for entries with the text "viewpoint" in the name field. The dataset does not have "viewpoint" in any name, so this query is incorrect.

4. **Query 4**: `You:[tool] Search(fields=[name, category, good for groups, viewpoint], filters=[good for groups OR viewpoint], sort_by=[distance_to(The Dive)])`
   - This query searches for entries with either "good for groups" or "viewpoint" and sorts them by distance to "The Dive". The dataset contains entries with these features, so this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 3 (Queries 1, 2, and 3)
- Number of correct queries: 1 (Query 4)

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 4, 3, 1.
