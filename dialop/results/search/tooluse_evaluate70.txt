To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1:**
   - **Search:** `category == bar OR category == restaurant`, `text_query=seafood`, `sort_by=[rating]`, `limit=5`
   - **Result:** The dataset does not contain any information about "seafood" in the `info` field for bars or restaurants. Therefore, this query is incorrect.
   
2. **Query 2:**
   - **Search:** `category == bar OR category == restaurant`, `text_query=outdoor seating AND city views`, `sort_by=[rating]`, `limit=5`
   - **Result:** The dataset does not contain any information about "city views" in the `info` field for bars or restaurants. Therefore, this query is incorrect.

3. **Query 3:**
   - **Search:** `category == bar OR category == restaurant`, `text_query=kid friendly`, `sort_by=[rating]`, `limit=5`
   - **Result:** The dataset contains information about whether a place is "Good for kids" in the `info` field for bars or restaurants. Therefore, this query is correct.

4. **Query 4:**
   - **Search:** `category == bar OR category == restaurant`, `sort_by=[distance_to(A-Trane)]`, `limit=5`
   - **Result:** The dataset contains location information, which can be used to calculate distance to "A-Trane". Therefore, this query is correct.

5. **Query 5:**
   - **Search:** `category == bar OR category == restaurant`, `text_query=vegan OR vegetarian`, `sort_by=[rating]`, `limit=5`
   - **Result:** The dataset contains information about "vegan options" and "vegetarian options" in the `info` field for bars or restaurants. Therefore, this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 2 (Query 1 and Query 2)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Query 3, Query 4, and Query 5)

[result]:: 5, 2, 3
