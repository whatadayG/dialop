To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, good for groups, viewpoint], text_query="Moabit Garden, The Arboretum")`
   - Result: `Moabit Garden` and `The Arboretum` are both present in the dataset with the correct fields.
   - Conclusion: Correct query.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, good for groups, has wifi], filters=[category == cafe OR category == restaurant], text_query="Thai, French, American, Spanish, Chinese food")`
   - Result: No results found.
   - Analysis: The dataset does not contain any cafes or restaurants with the specified cuisines in the text query.
   - Conclusion: Correct query, as the dataset does not have matching entries.

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, good for groups, has wifi], filters=[category == cafe OR category == restaurant], sort_by=[good for groups, has wifi])`
   - Result: The results are sorted by `good for groups` and `has wifi`.
   - Analysis: The dataset contains cafes and restaurants, and the sorting is done correctly based on the available data.
   - Conclusion: Correct query.

Now, let's summarize the findings:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 0
- Number of correct queries: 3

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 3, 0, 3
