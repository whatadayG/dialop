To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - **Query:** Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == cafe, info == wifi, info == outdoor seating, info == good for groups])
   - **Result:** Common Grounds is returned, but it does not have "wifi" in its features.
   - **Conclusion:** Incorrect query because the result does not match all the filters.

2. **Second Query:**
   - **Query:** Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[info == live music, info == viewpoint, info == good for groups])
   - **Result:** No results.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct query because there is no entry in the dataset that matches all three filters.

3. **Third Query:**
   - **Query:** Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[info == live music, info == good for groups])
   - **Result:** Bards n Brews, The Jazz Spot, The Cakery are returned.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct query because Bards n Brews and The Cakery match both filters, and The Jazz Spot matches "live music" but not "good for groups," which is acceptable as the query does not specify that both conditions must be met simultaneously.

4. **Fourth Query:**
   - **Query:** Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[info == viewpoint, info == good for groups])
   - **Result:** Atlas Park, Riverside Trail are returned.
   - **Conclusion:** Correct query because both Atlas Park and Riverside Trail match both filters.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (First query)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Second, Third, and Fourth queries)

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 4, 1, 3.
