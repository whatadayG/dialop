To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1:**
   - **Search:** `touristy spots with city views and parking`
   - **Result:** `Hindenberg Memorial`, `Atlas Park`, `Moabit Garden`
   - **Analysis:** The query asks for touristy spots with city views and parking. The dataset does not explicitly mention "city views," but it does mention "touristy" and "has parking." The results are correct based on the available data.
   - **Correct**

2. **Query 2:**
   - **Search:** `category == restaurant, good for groups, has parking`, `kosher OR Chinese`
   - **Result:** No results
   - **Analysis:** The dataset does not have any restaurants that are good for groups, have parking, and are either kosher or Chinese. The result is correct.
   - **Correct**

3. **Query 3:**
   - **Search:** `category == restaurant, good for groups, has parking`
   - **Result:** `Earthbar`
   - **Analysis:** `Earthbar` is a restaurant that is good for groups, but it does not have parking. The result is incorrect.
   - **Incorrect**

4. **Query 4:**
   - **Search:** `category == restaurant, good for groups`, `kosher OR Chinese`
   - **Result:** `Earthbar`, `Mad Seoul`
   - **Analysis:** The dataset does not specify any restaurant as kosher or Chinese. The result is incorrect.
   - **Incorrect**

5. **Query 5:**
   - **Search:** `category != restaurant, has parking`, `touristy`
   - **Result:** `The Mall`, `Atlas Park`, `Garden of Wonders`, `The Arboretum`, `City Museum of Art`, `Hindenberg Memorial`, `Vista Ridge Mall`, `Central Plaza`, `Moabit Garden`
   - **Analysis:** The query asks for non-restaurant places that are touristy and have parking. The results include places that meet these criteria. The result is correct.
   - **Correct**

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 2 (Queries 3 and 4)
- Number of correct queries: 3 (Queries 1, 2, and 5)

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 5, 2, 3
