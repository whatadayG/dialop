To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], text_query="live music, takeout, good for groups", sort_by=[price], limit=5)`

     - Mad Seoul: No live music, no takeout, not specified if good for groups.
     - Taqueria y Mas: Live music, has takeout, not good for groups.
   - The query is partially correct as it includes some results that match the criteria but also includes results that do not fully match.

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, category, info], filters=[category == museum], sort_by=[distance_to(The Dockside Grill)], limit=5)`
