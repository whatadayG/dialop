To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, good for groups, has wifi]`
   - **Filters:** `category == cafe OR restaurant, good for groups == True, has wifi == True`
   - **Text Query:** `not hipster`
   - **Result:** `Common Grounds` and `Asha Tea House`
   - **Analysis:** Both results are cafes, good for groups, and have wifi. However, `Asha Tea House` has an "ambience" of "hipster," which contradicts the text query "not hipster." Therefore, this query is incorrect.

2. **Query 2:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, good for groups, has wifi]`
   - **Filters:** `category == restaurant, good for groups == True, has wifi == True`
   - **Sort By:** `distance_to(Common Grounds)`
   - **Result:** No results
   - **Analysis:** The dataset does not have any restaurants that are good for groups and have wifi. Therefore, the query is correct as it correctly returns no results.

3. **Query 3:**
   - **Search:** `fields=[name, category, good for groups]`
   - **Filters:** `good for groups == True`
   - **Sort By:** `distance_to(Common Grounds, Mad Seoul)`
   - **Limit:** `1`
   - **Result:** `Mad Seoul`
   - **Analysis:** `Mad Seoul` is a restaurant that is good for groups. The query correctly identifies it as the closest to either `Common Grounds` or `Mad Seoul` itself. Therefore, this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 1)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (Query 2 and Query 3)

Therefore, the result is: 

[result]:: 3, 1, 2
