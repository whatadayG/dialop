To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=wifi)`
   - This query searches for entries with "wifi" in the name field.
   - The results include "The Cupcake Bar", "Coffee Nook", "Common Grounds", "Asha Tea House", and "Harper and Rye".
   - Upon checking the dataset, all these entries have "wifi" as a feature, except "Harper and Rye", which does not have "wifi" in its features.
   - Therefore, this query is incorrect.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query=vegetarian OR vegan)`
   - This query searches for restaurants with either "vegetarian" or "vegan" in their features.
   - The results include "Caribbean Corner", "Mad Seoul", "The Cupcake Bar", and "Schwarzes Cafe".
   - "Caribbean Corner" and "Mad Seoul" are restaurants with "vegan options".
   - "The Cupcake Bar" and "Schwarzes Cafe" are cafes, not restaurants, so they should not be included.
   - Therefore, this query is incorrect.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == shop], text_query=The Mall OR Market Street)`
   - This query searches for shops with names "The Mall" or "Market Street".
   - The results include "The Mall" and "Market Street".
   - Both entries are shops and match the names specified in the query.
   - Therefore, this query is correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 3
- Number of incorrect queries: 2
- Number of correct queries: 1

[result]:: 3, 2, 1
