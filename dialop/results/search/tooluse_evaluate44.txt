To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **First Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant], text_query="serves wine vegetarian options")`
   - The dataset does not have a "serves wine" feature for restaurants. The query is incorrect because it uses a feature that doesn't exist in the dataset.
   - Result: Incorrect

2. **Second Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == landmark OR category == bar], text_query="good for groups live music")`
   - The query is looking for landmarks or bars that are good for groups and have live music. The dataset shows "The Dive" as a bar with live music, but not good for groups. "The Tower" is a landmark but does not have live music. The query is incorrect because it doesn't match the criteria correctly.
   - Result: Incorrect

3. **Third Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == landmark OR category == bar], text_query="good for groups live music", sort_by=[distance_to(Cookies Cream)])`
   - The query is similar to the second one but adds sorting by distance to "Cookies Cream". The results include "The Tower" and "The Dive", which do not meet the criteria of being good for groups and having live music. The query is incorrect.
   - Result: Incorrect

4. **Fourth Query:**
   - Query: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == landmark OR category == bar], text_query="good for groups live music", sort_by=[distance_to(Cookies Cream)], limit=2)`
   - This query is the same as the third one but with a limit of 2. The results are the same and do not meet the criteria. The query is incorrect.
   - Result: Incorrect

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 4
- Number of incorrect queries: 4
- Number of correct queries: 0

Therefore, the result is: [result]:: 4, 4, 0.
