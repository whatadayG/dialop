To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=vegetarian or vegan)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names containing "vegetarian" or "vegan" and returns results that match the dataset.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=landmark)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names containing "landmark" and returns results that match the dataset.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name], text_query=wifi)`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names containing "wifi" and returns results that match the dataset.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, rating], filters=[rating > 4.5], sort_by=[distance_to(Asha Tea House)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for names and ratings with a filter for ratings greater than 4.5 and sorts by distance to "Asha Tea House". The result matches the dataset.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, rating, info], filters=[category == restaurant, rating > 4.5, info contains vegetarian or vegan], sort_by=[distance_to(Asha Tea House)])`
   - This query is incorrect. It searches for restaurants with a rating greater than 4.5 and info containing "vegetarian" or "vegan", but there are no such results in the dataset.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, rating, info], filters=[category == restaurant, info contains vegetarian or vegan], sort_by=[distance_to(Asha Tea House)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for restaurants with info containing "vegetarian" or "vegan" and sorts by distance to "Asha Tea House". The results match the dataset.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, rating, info], filters=[category == restaurant, info contains vegetarian or vegan], sort_by=[distance_to(Hindenberg Memorial)])`
   - This query is correct. It searches for restaurants with info containing "vegetarian" or "vegan" and sorts by distance to "Hindenberg Memorial". The results match the dataset.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 7
- Number of incorrect queries: 1 (Query 5)
- Number of correct queries: 6

Therefore, the result is:

[result]:: 7, 1, 6
