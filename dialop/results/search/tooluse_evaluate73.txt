To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant, good for groups, has parking], text_query="Ethiopian OR seafood")`
   - Incorrect. The result returned is "Mad Seoul," which does not have parking.

   - Incorrect. The result returned is "Mad Seoul," which does not have parking.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant, good for groups, has parking])`
   - Incorrect. The result returned is "Central Plaza," which is a shop, not a restaurant.

   - Incorrect. The result returned is "Taqueria y Mas," which does not have parking.

   - Correct. The results returned are "Mad Seoul" and "Saul's," both of which match the criteria.

6. **Query 6**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant, has wifi, has takeout], text_query="Ethiopian OR seafood")`
   - Correct. No results found, which is correct since no restaurant in the dataset has wifi.

7. **Query 7**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant, has wifi], text_query="Ethiopian OR seafood")`
   - Correct. No results found, which is correct since no restaurant in the dataset has wifi.

8. **Query 8**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant, has wifi])`
   - Correct. No results found, which is correct since no restaurant in the dataset has wifi.

9. **Query 9**: `Search(fields=[name, info], text_query="wifi")`
   - Correct. No results found, which is correct since no entity in the dataset has wifi.

10. **Query 10**: `Search(fields=[name, info], filters=[category == restaurant, has takeout], text_query="wifi")`
    - Correct. No results found, which is correct since no restaurant in the dataset has wifi.
