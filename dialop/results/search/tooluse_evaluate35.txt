To determine the total number of queries, the number of incorrect queries, and the number of correct queries, let's analyze each query step by step:

1. **Query 1**: `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, has_wifi], filters=[rating > 4, has_wifi == True])`
   - The dataset shows "The Cupcake Bar" as a cafe with `has_wifi` as True, but it doesn't have a rating. "BAMPFA" is a museum with a rating of 4.5 but `has_wifi` is False. Therefore, the search results are incorrect because "The Cupcake Bar" does not have a rating greater than 4.

2. **Query 2**: `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, has_wifi, outdoor_seating], filters=[rating > 4, has_wifi == True, outdoor_seating == True])`
   - The dataset shows "The Cupcake Bar" as a cafe with `has_wifi` as True and `outdoor_seating` as False. Therefore, the search results are incorrect because "The Cupcake Bar" does not have `outdoor_seating` as True.

3. **Query 3**: `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, has_wifi, outdoor_seating], filters=[rating > 4, has_wifi == True, outdoor_seating == True, category == cafe])`
   - The search results are correct because there are no cafes with a rating greater than 4, `has_wifi` as True, and `outdoor_seating` as True.

4. **Query 4**: `Search(fields=[name, category, rating], filters=[rating > 4, category == shop])`
   - The dataset shows "Artisan Street Fair" as a shop with a rating of 4. The search results are incorrect because the rating is not greater than 4.

5. **Query 5**: `Search(fields=[name, category, rating, outdoor_seating], filters=[rating > 4, outdoor_seating == True])`
   - The dataset shows "The Dockside Grill" and "Mad Seoul" as having a rating greater than 4 and `outdoor_seating` as True. The search results are correct.

Now, let's summarize the results:
- Total number of queries: 5
- Number of incorrect queries: 3 (Queries 1, 2, and 4)
- Number of correct queries: 2 (Queries 3 and 5)

[result]:: 5, 3, 2
