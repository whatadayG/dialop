You are a conversation strategy expert. You are given a conversation history, 
and you need to give 3 different strategies that the agent should use to respond to the user.
The goal of the strategy is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the final itinerary the agent proposes matches the user's preferences compounded by how important the preferences are to the user. 
Here are some things you should consider when designing the strategy:
1. you can only propose 3 locations in the final itinerary, so you should understand the user's priorities and make sure the final itinerary includes the most important places
2. you should try to make sure there's no important preferences that the user forgets to mention
3. you should try to use tools to get more information about places
4. you should try to do all of the above with as short conversation length as possible
Your output should be a list of 3 conversational strategies, each on a new line. For each strategy, you should format it as succinct instructions and explanations to the agent on how to communicate with the user.

Here is the conversation history:
