"Travel Preferences:\ngroup of 7, best if we could go to places good for groups\ngo to at least one shop\nwould be great if everything is reservable in advance\nkeep budget below $90\nfind a place with wifi to do some work at some point\nCOVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best\nrenting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok\ndon't like romantic places\nprefer just eating takeout\ndefinitely want to go to Kozy Kar\nminimize travel distance"
