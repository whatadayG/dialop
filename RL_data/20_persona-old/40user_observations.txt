"Travel Preferences:\nhidden spots much better than tourist traps\ngo to at least one shop\nkeep budget below $80\nwould love to see some panoramic views of the city\ndon't like romantic places\nrenting a car so preferably places with parking, but street parking also ok\nCOVID conscious, outdoor seating places would be best\ngenerally like eating vegan options\nwould be great if everything is reservable in advance\nheard these bars were good: A-Trane, The Dive\nminimize travel distance"
